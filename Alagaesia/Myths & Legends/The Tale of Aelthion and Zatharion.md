#### From _"Celestial Myths & Divine Histories"_ by Loremaster Caelwyn Eltharion

In the time long before Zarros ascended to his rightful place as a god of knowledge, when the world was still young and its mysteries vast, there existed only one great and ancient god of knowledge—Aelthion. He was the god of magic, of exploration, and of learning. His mind was vast, his curiosity boundless, and the world had long been his canvas upon which he painted the wonders of the cosmos. While Aelthion revelled in the discovery of forgotten secrets and the unlocking of ancient truths, there was one thing he could never quite conquer: he could not find someone who shared his insatiable curiosity.

It was in this time of solitude that Zarros—known then as Zatharion—first appeared. He was young, brimming with potential but unrefined, and his talents were raw. Zatharion was not yet the god of knowledge that he would one day become, but he was already showing signs of brilliance. He had already begun to learn the basics of crafting tools and machines, yet he was still searching for a true understanding of the world around him.

One day, as Aelthion wandered the plains of Du Weldenvarden, exploring the realms of magic and unseen forces, he came across Zatharion—working diligently at his forge, hammering away at metal in the hopes of crafting something greater than he had yet achieved. His creations were crude by Aelthion's standards, but they showed promise. The younger god’s mind was bent on invention, his thoughts on how the world could be shaped by tools and mastery over the natural forces.

Aelthion watched for a time, fascinated by the raw drive that burned within Zatharion. But something in the young god’s approach stirred Aelthion’s deep, timeless curiosity. He saw that Zatharion was missing something—an understanding of the natural world beyond the tools he sought to create.

Approaching him, Aelthion spoke in his soft, melodic voice. “Zatharion, you are a god of great potential, but you seek to build without knowing the world that lies beneath your creations. The magic that flows through the world is not simply a tool to be bent to your will. It is an art, a force that must be understood, not mastered.”

Zatharion, surprised by the voice of the older god, looked up from his work. His eyes narrowed, a mix of defiance and curiosity within them. “And what would you know of it, Aelthion? You who delve into the realm of the mind and the cosmos? I seek to shape the world, not simply study it. The world should serve me, not the other way around.”

Aelthion smiled softly, his eyes twinkling with the wisdom of ages. “I do not deny your desire to shape the world, Zatharion. But you will find, as I have, that the greatest creations are those that emerge from understanding. The world is not a tool to be wielded; it is a living, breathing thing that has its own rules. The true magic of the world lies not just in the power you seek to control, but in the way it flows, in the way it can be felt, understood, and joined in harmony.”

Zatharion stood, his youthful arrogance flaring. “And how do you propose I learn this ‘magic’? Magic is not a thing that can be studied in the way you speak of it.”

Aelthion placed a hand gently on the forge Zatharion had been working on, still warm from his efforts. “Magic, my young friend, is the breath of life itself. It is not confined to spells or rituals—it is the language of creation. If you wish to understand it, you must first learn to listen.”

Zatharion raised an eyebrow, scepticism in his voice. “And you will teach me to listen? To hear the world’s secrets as you do?”

Aelthion nodded, his smile widening. “I will show you. But it is you who must listen. Come with me.”

With that, Aelthion led Zatharion to the heart of Du Weldenvarden, to a place where the trees grew ancient and thick, their trunks gnarled and wide, their roots reaching deep into the earth. The air was thick with the pulse of magic, alive with energy and secrets. Aelthion led Zatharion to a hidden glade, where a pool of water glimmered with an ethereal glow.

“This is the Pool of Reflection,” Aelthion explained. “It is a place where the magic of the world reveals itself not through force, but through stillness. Here, you will learn to hear the world.”

Zatharion looked at the pool with scepticism, but Aelthion gestured for him to sit. “Close your eyes,” Aelthion instructed. “And listen. Not with your ears, but with your soul.”

Zatharion, though doubtful, did as he was told. He sat by the pool, feeling the coolness of the stone beneath him, the stillness of the air around him. At first, there was only silence. But slowly, as his thoughts began to quiet, he felt something. A faint hum beneath his senses, a pulse, a rhythm. It was as if the world itself was speaking, but not in words. It was the sound of life, of the earth, of the very forces that held creation together.

“This is the magic you seek,” Aelthion said softly. “It is not something you can bend to your will. It is something you must become attuned to. Magic is not simply a force—it is the very essence of all things. And only by listening, by understanding its flow, can you learn to shape it.”

Zatharion’s eyes snapped open, his heart racing with newfound wonder. For the first time, he truly understood. It was not his inventions that would make him great; it was his understanding of the world that would give him the power to create. The magic was not a tool—it was a gift, a language, and in that moment, Zatharion vowed to learn it, to master its subtleties.

“I understand now,” Zatharion whispered. “I have been looking at the world through the wrong lens. Magic is not something I can control—it is something I must learn to work with.”

Aelthion smiled, his eyes gleaming with approval. “Indeed. Now, let us return. There is much more for you to learn. The world is full of wonders, Zatharion. And now, you are ready to begin truly discovering them.”

From that day forward, Zarros—Zatharion—devoted himself to the pursuit of knowledge, not as a means of control, but as a means of understanding. He learned the ways of magic, of the natural world, and of the forgotten arts, his mind ever expanding. He grew to become the god of knowledge, but he never forgot the lessons Aelthion had taught him. It was not in invention alone that true knowledge lay—it was in the harmony of the world, in listening to the whispers of magic, and in understanding the world’s deeper truths.

And though their paths diverged, Aelthion and Zarros would always share a bond, forged in that moment of discovery, the spark that turned Zatharion into the god he would one day become.
