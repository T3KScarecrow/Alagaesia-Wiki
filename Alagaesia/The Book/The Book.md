A man, not quite Elven nor wholly Human, wearing **ROBES** and a **PENDANT** stood in the street checking a note. 

*Gabriel **SOMETHING** of **SOMETHING CHURCHY**                  13th Marcion 1342
I hope this letter finds you well.
After an intense combing through of candidates, the Grand Museum Of Arcane History
is glad to welcome you into its newest initiative. For your convenience, you shall find accommodation at the Silver Quill Tavern, paid for by the MOAH. Please arrive at the MOAH 
on the 14th at midday to meet your partymates and for more instructions.

*Professionally,

Gabriel pocketed the small letter and looked around the street. He had only been in Caelora City for a short while now, and had rarely explored the Guild District. It had taken him twenty minutes to find the Silver Quill, and reasoned that the Museum would choose the closest tavern to serve the members of its "newest initiative". Gabriel did not know much about the job he had signed up for, but what he did know was thus; he would be joining a contracted group of adventurers, and would be travelling across much of Caldoran. Gabriel did not care much himself for adventuring or those who partake in it. He had signed up in pursuit of the knowledge he might uncover. After another twenty or so minutes of wandering, Gabriel saw them; the grandiose marble pillars, the ancient-inspired architecture, a group of curiously dressed individuals standing out the front, each unique from the others. Gabriel approached the group, assessing them as he neared: A menacing Automaton who seems tall in posture and presence yet is only average in height. The almost-midday sun glinted magically off its intricate dark steel armour-skin. A fit and slender Human woman, a warrior or soldier no doubt
