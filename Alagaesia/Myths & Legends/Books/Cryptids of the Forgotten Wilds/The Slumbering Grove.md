#### From _"Cryptids of the Forgotten Wilds"_ by Gaerith Thornwillow

In the heart of the Great Forest lies a mythical place known as the Slumbering Grove. It is said to be a sanctuary where the world’s greatest creatures, long thought extinct, rest in an enchanted sleep. Wyrms, titanic beasts, and even ancient treants are whispered to dwell within this grove, their breaths slow and rhythmic, creating a symphony of slumber.

Elven myths suggest that the grove was created by Aeloria to safeguard her mysteries. Those who wander too close speak of a heavy drowsiness that overcomes them, forcing them to sleep alongside the ancient creatures. Few ever awaken, and those who do claim to have seen impossible sights: a wyrm curled around a tree larger than a mountain, its scales shimmering like polished gemstones, or a serpent whose coils seem to span entire valleys.

The Slumbering Grove is more than a myth to some; it is a promise that the world still holds its wonders. Whether it is a dream, a blessing, or a curse, only the bravest—or most foolish—dare seek its truth.
