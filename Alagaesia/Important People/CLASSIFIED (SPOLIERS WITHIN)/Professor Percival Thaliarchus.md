### **Name**: **Professor Percival Thaliarchus** *(though his name changes slightly with each regeneration)*  
- Examples: Percival, Thal, Archus, Percy, Valus, etc.  
- Nickname: **“The Professor”**, as he is fondly known by many.

---

### **Race**:  
**Human** (originally), though his nature has since become something unique due to magical forces.

---

### **Backstory and Origin**:  

Centuries ago, Percival Thaliarchus was born in **Caelora**, the son of humble alchemists. From an early age, he displayed an uncanny brilliance, inventing intricate contraptions and delving into mysteries of magic with an insatiable curiosity. His life took a dramatic turn during an experiment that was meant to unify **transmutation magic** and **healing magic**—a field he called "Vitalic Alchemy."  

Percival’s experiment was noble in intent: to create a device that could heal wounds and even extend life by repairing the body at a fundamental level. However, something went terribly wrong when he combined **conjuration**, **transmutation**, and **divine magic** channelled from both **Vitalas** (Goddess of Healing and Compassion) and **Zarros** (God of Knowledge and Discovery).  

Instead of healing or extending life in a conventional sense, the magical forces tore through his body and soul, leaving him gravely injured. But then, his body shimmered and shifted, morphing into a younger, unfamiliar version of himself. Percival had unwittingly fused his essence with **pure transmutation magic**, anchored by divine blessings from Vitalas and Zarros, creating a cycle of **regenerative rebirth**.

### **The Nature of His Regeneration**:  

Percival’s regenerative ability ensures that whenever he dies—whether by injury, age, or accident—his body completely rewrites itself into a new form, renewing his youth but altering his appearance, personality quirks, and even some memories.  

- **The Blessing of Vitalas**: His gift (or curse) ensures his continued existence so he can heal and protect others. His body repairs itself fully upon death, but it cannot retain the exact same form.  
- **The Blessing of Zarros**: His regeneration imbues him with flashes of inspiration and knowledge, sometimes fragmenting his memories to make room for new ideas.  
- **Side Effects**: He sometimes forgets details of past lives (especially personal relationships), but his passion for invention and discovery always endures. His personality can shift slightly—becoming more reserved, eccentric, or daring, depending on the “version.”

### **Personality**:  
The Professor is:  
- **Quirky**: Always armed with odd sayings, unusual habits, and peculiar outfits.  
- **Inventive**: Constantly sketching, building, or tinkering with contraptions no one else understands.  
- **Compassionate**: Driven by an unyielding desire to help others and improve the world.  
- **Eccentric**: Prone to bursts of energy, erratic behavior, and leaps of logic that somehow always work out.  
- **A Touch of Sadness**: Beneath his cheer is a layer of loneliness. He’s lived through generations, outlived friends, and sometimes feels disconnected from the mortal world.  

---

### **Notable Accomplishments and Goals**:  
- **Inventor Extraordinaire**: His inventions include early prototypes of airships, water purification systems, and mechanical golems. His greatest ambition is to build a **network of magical trains**—an innovation he calls the "Arcane Rail."  
- **Discoverer of Lost Knowledge**: Percival has a knack for uncovering Forebearer artifacts and deciphering their technology, which inspires his own creations.  
- **Traveler of the World**: Over his centuries, he has wandered to nearly every corner of the known lands and even explored Du Weldenvarden, gaining the respect of elves, dwarves, and even tritons.  

---

### **Key Features**:  
- **Signature Item**: A mysterious, **cursed/blessed amulet**, the **Aeternal Prism**, hangs around his neck. He believes this amulet stabilized his soul during the fateful experiment. It glows faintly with celestial light during moments of intense emotion or danger.  
  - **The Prism’s Role**: The amulet sustains his regeneration cycle and might even guide it, subtly shaping his forms to meet the world’s needs at the time. He has tried to remove it, but it always reappears after his death.  

- **Signature Invention**: The **Infinity Coil**, a multi-purpose magical device that generates power for his creations and enhances spellcasting. It’s also the prototype for the engine that will drive the Arcane Rail.  

---

### **Important Relationships**:  
- **Vesper (the Elf Orphan from Du Weldenvarden)**: A former companion who joined him on a grand journey during one of his past lives. Vesper now keeps tabs on him, fascinated by his regenerations.  
- **A Rival Artificer**: A Mechinator named **Lord Ferrius**, who sees Percival as both a nuisance and an unrecognized genius whose regenerative ability should be "harvested" for Mechinator experiments.  
- **The Arcane Rail Team**: A group of talented engineers, artificers, and workers who are helping him bring his vision of a connected world to life.

### **Hooks for the Campaign**:  
1. **Uncovering His Origins**: The players could help him uncover the deeper mysteries of his regeneration—was it really a blessing from the gods, or something more sinister?  
2. **Sabotage of the Arcane Rail**: As construction begins, rival factions (like the Mechinators or the Enlightened) seek to destroy it, and Percival needs help to protect his dream.  
3. **A Mysterious Death**: The Professor is killed early in the campaign and regenerates before the party’s eyes, leaving them shocked and questioning his nature.  
4. **Forebearer Ties**: Artifacts or ancient writings might suggest that Percival’s abilities are linked to the Forebearers, hinting at a much larger purpose for his existence.
