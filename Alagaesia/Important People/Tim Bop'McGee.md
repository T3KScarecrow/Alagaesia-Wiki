Tim Bop McGee is aspiring musician, but is feeling out the world. Born to a mixed elf-human family of herb merchants. His elf relatives left Du Weldenvarden to pursue herbalism in the world outside the forest, where they accidentally started to turn quite a profit due to their high quality herbs. This psuedo-wealth led to them being granted nobility.

Tim'Bop'Mcgee left home at 19 with the cloths on his back, a lute, and a mire $50,000 gold that he spent on Fine wine, Ritz hotels, and many encounters with many strangers. He is down to X gold "however much he has now" After throwing a month long party for his birthday in a random town in which he invited everyone form there to 3 towns over. Now strapped for cash, he joins a gang of people. (where we are today) While he tries to, but to no avail, sell his new invention... The cigarette. While he plays from town to town. he believes if he becomes famous he might sell his cigarette. (he will not be able to sell them)
