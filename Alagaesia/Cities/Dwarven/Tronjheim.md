The dwarven capital city Tronjheim stands as a monumental testament to the craftsmanship, ingenuity, and resilience of the Stoners. Carved deep into the heart of the Ironspine Mountains, Tronjheim is a vast, subterranean metropolis hidden beneath the earth, protected by sheer cliffs and labyrinthine tunnels that only the dwarves can navigate with ease.

### **The City’s Structure**
At the heart of the underground realm, Tronjheim is centred around a massive, mile-high stone spire that rises from the base of a titanic hollowed-out cavern. This spire, known as the Throne of Stone, houses the royal halls and the seat of dwarven power. Surrounding the spire, the cavern’s walls are dotted with dwellings, workshops, forges, and guild halls, all interconnected by bridges, walkways, and tunnels. From a distance, it appears as though the city itself is clinging to the rock, built into every available surface.

The light within Tronjheim is provided by the Glowstones, enchanted gems embedded into the walls and ceilings that radiate a soft, warm light, mimicking the cycles of day and night. The dwarves, as master miners, have enhanced the natural beauty of the stone with intricate carvings, reliefs, and frescoes depicting the history of their people, their gods, and their ancient alliances with the Forebearers.

### **The Great Hall of Duraz-Galdak**
At the base of the Throne of Stone lies the Great Hall of Duraz-Galdak, the ceremonial and political heart of Tronjheim. The hall is an immense chamber with towering columns, each one a marvel of craftsmanship, engraved with the names of every dwarven king and queen since the founding of the city. At the far end of the hall sits the Stone Throne, a seat carved from a single piece of mountain rock where the current ruler, King Galdur Stonefist, presides over his people.

The hall is not only the seat of government but also a place of gathering for the Stone Council, a body of elders and guild leaders who help advise the king. Important events, such as the forging of alliances, declarations of war, and festivals honouring the dwarf gods, take place here, beneath the watchful eyes of colossal stone statues of dwarven ancestors.

### **Forges and Artisans’ Quarters**
Beneath the city lies the Infernal Forge, a series of interconnected magma chambers used by dwarven smiths and artificers to create some of the finest weapons, armour, and mechanical constructs in the land. The heat from the magma flows is carefully harnessed through a complex network of channels, allowing the dwarves to work with metals and ores that no other race can manage.

The Artisans’ Quarters, located near the forges, is where the greatest craftsmen of Tronjheim work, fashioning intricate jewellery, stonework, and mechanical wonders. Dwarves are known for their innovation, and their mechanical creations, from clockwork devices to grand automatons, are highly prized by all who come to trade with them.

### **The Living Districts**
The dwarves of Tronjheim live in homes carved into the cavern walls, connected by wide stone bridges that arch over the city’s central spire. Each district is divided by guild or clan, and the architecture reflects the clan’s traditions. Some homes are adorned with rich tapestries and gold inlay, while others remain simple, focusing on functionality over form. Though the city lies deep underground, it is kept warm by geothermal energy, and the Glowstones provide both light and a sense of comfort.

### **The Grand Stair and the City Gates**
The Grand Stair spirals around the Throne of Stone, allowing access to all levels of the city. It is lined with statues of famous dwarven heroes and forefathers, as well as intricate stone murals that depict their victories and struggles. The Gates of Tronjheim themselves are a marvel: massive, unyielding doors of steel and stone, enchanted to repel all but the most powerful of attacks. Outside the gates, only a few waystations mark the treacherous route through the mountains to reach the city, and these are well-guarded by dwarven warriors known as the Stone Sentinels.

### **The Dwarven Tunnels and Secret Paths**
Though Tronjheim is a hidden fortress, the dwarves have mastered the art of building unseen paths throughout the Ironspine Mountains. These Hidden Roads are known only to the Stoners, and they allow for the movement of troops, trade caravans, and even ambush parties with unparalleled secrecy. The dwarves also maintain a network of Ventilation Shafts that provide fresh air from the surface, cunningly disguised as natural formations to prevent discovery.

### **Religion and Tradition**
At the base of the Throne of Stone lies the Shrine of the Stonefather, Guntera, the chief deity of the dwarves. The temple is a solemn, echoing chamber where dwarves come to offer prayers, seek guidance, and honour their ancestors. The dwarves believe that the Stonefather’s essence is woven into the very rock of Tronjheim, and that as long as they remain true to their traditions, their city will stand eternal.

In this campaign, Tronjheim is not just a city but a living monument to the dwarves' mastery of stone, metal, and magic. Hidden deep within the mountains, it serves as a fortress, a home, and a sacred place, where the past and present meet in the unyielding stone walls that have stood since before the Fall of the Forebearers.
