#### From "Celestial Myths & Divine Histories" by Loremaster Caelwyn Eltharion

Long ago, in the time before the first cities were built and the first kingdoms rose, the world was a place of unrelenting struggle. Mortals fought against the elements, beasts, and one another for survival, and death was as constant as the rising sun. No divine presence was as revered or as essential as Vitalas, the Goddess of Compassion and Healing, whose gentle touch soothed the wounds of the world and whose grace extended to all who suffered.

Vitalas was born not of the sky or the earth but from the hearts of mortals themselves—her essence woven from the tears of those who had lost loved ones, from the quiet cries of the sick and the weary, and from the silent prayers whispered in the dark of night. Her form was gentle and ever-changing, with the radiance of a comforting light and the warmth of a loving embrace. Wherever there was suffering, there was Vitalas, with her hands always ready to heal and her heart open to listen.

However, Vitalas’s greatest test came when the mortal realm fell into the grips of a terrible plague. The pestilence was like no other before it, a sickness that spread through villages and cities alike, draining the life from the strong and the weak alike. No medicine or spell could cure it, and the land grew heavy with the weight of grief and loss. The people cried out to the gods, but none came, for all the gods were tied to the forces of nature, and this plague was beyond even their power to stem.

Hearing the lamentations of mortals, Vitalas descended from her realm, her steps light and soothing like a spring breeze. She found the people broken, their bodies wracked with fever, their hearts heavy with hopelessness. She wept for them, for there was nothing she could do to stop the plague once it had taken root in the world. Yet she knew she could ease their pain, and so she began her work.

For days and nights, Vitalas tended to the sick, her hands glowing with divine light as she touched fevered brows and eased the suffering of the dying. She held them, one by one, as they took their final breaths, whispering words of comfort and love. In her presence, the pain of death was softened, and the terror of the unknown was quelled by the warmth of her embrace. Those who passed in her arms were not alone, and they went peacefully into the next world, where they would find solace and rest.

But even as she healed, Vitalas knew that she could not cure the plague. Her compassion was boundless, but she was not omnipotent. In the face of such overwhelming despair, she felt the weight of her own limitations, and for the first time, her radiant light dimmed with sorrow. She wandered through the lands, comforting those she could, but as the plague spread further, her heart grew heavy with the grief of so many lives lost.

One fateful day, as Vitalas sat beside the banks of a great river, her heart ached in a way it never had before. She gazed upon the waters, flowing endlessly and calmly, as if unaffected by the chaos that raged all around. The river was a symbol of life, of vitality, and yet it could not escape the sickness that had gripped the land. As the sound of the water flowed through her, she began to weep. Her tears, mixed with the sorrow of the dying and the hopeless, fell into the river, and in that moment, something miraculous occurred.

Where her tears fell, the waters of the river began to glow with a soft, golden light. The plague, though not vanquished, seemed to ease as the river carried her divine compassion into the land. Where once the earth was dry with grief, the river began to heal the soil, and where the fields had been barren, flowers began to bloom. Though the plague still raged, its effects lessened in the wake of Vitalas’s touch, as if the river itself had become a conduit for her healing energy.

In the days that followed, the people began to notice the change. The waters of the river, once cold and indifferent, now offered comfort and relief. Those who drank from it found their strength renewed, their sickness abated. The river became a symbol of hope, its waters infused with the compassion and healing of the goddess. Vitalas continued her work, tending to the souls of the dying and offering her solace to the suffering, but now, she had discovered a new way to share her divine gift with the world.

To this day, the river that Vitalas wept into is known as the Weeping River, and its waters are considered sacred by those who dwell near it. Pilgrims travel from all corners of the world to drink from its waters, hoping to find healing and comfort for their own pains, and it is said that, if one listens closely, they can hear the gentle whispers of Vitalas’s voice in the flow of the current. For though the goddess herself has returned to her celestial realm, her compassion still flows through the waters of that sacred river, a reminder of the boundless love and healing she offers to all who suffer.

And so, Vitalas’s legacy lives on—not in the cure of every ailment, for even the goddess of healing could not end all suffering—but in the quiet, steady flow of compassion that can ease the heart, soothe the soul, and remind mortals that they are never truly alone.
