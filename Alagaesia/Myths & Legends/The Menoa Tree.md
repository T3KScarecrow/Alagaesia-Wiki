In the depths of Du Weldenvarden,  
Hidden amongst the green,  
Lies the ancient and wonderful Menoa garden.

A beautiful rift, separate from reality,  
Wherein stands a sentinel of morality.  
Menoa rises up to the sky,  
Protecting her plants  
With her ever-watchful eye.

But before Menoa could reach for the heavens,  
She had to first plunge her roots down to hell,  
For Menoa was born of sorrow’s well.

Once a maiden with song in her voice,  
Her laughter like rain, her beauty a choice.  
She loved and was loved, or so she believed,  
Until trust was broken, her heart deceived.

With fury untamed, she wielded the blade,  
In passion’s shadow, two lives she unmade.  
Her soul, then stained with anguish and sin,  
Sought the forest's heart to begin again.

For three days and nights, she sang her despair,  
To the oldest tree, her burden laid bare.  
A plea for redemption, a song of remorse,  
Her tears fed the earth, her voice set the course.

And when her song faded, the forest had spoken,  
Her body embraced, her sins left unbroken.  
No longer mere elf, but guardian divine,  
She became the tree, her penance enshrined.

Now Menoa stands, both silent and wise,  
Her branches like arms, her leaves like sighs.  
Elves gather beneath, their songs to impart,  
Seeking her counsel, her ancient heart.

Her roots hold secrets, her bark holds time,  
A monument born from the weight of her crime.  
Menoa reminds, through ages untold,  
That even in darkness, growth takes hold.
