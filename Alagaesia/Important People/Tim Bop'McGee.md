Tim'Bop'McGee is aspiring musician, but is feeling out the world. Born to a mixed elf-human family of herb merchants. His elf relatives left Du Weldenvarden to pursue herbalism in the world outside the forest, where they accidentally started to turn quite a profit due to their high quality herbs. This pseudo-wealth led to them being granted nobility.

Tim'Bop'Mcgee left home at 19 with the cloths on his back, a lute, and a mere 50,000 gold that he spent on fine wine, ritz hotels, and many encounters with many strangers. He is down to 34 gold, after throwing a month long party for his birthday in a random town in which he invited everyone form there to 3 towns over. Now strapped for cash, he joins a gang of people. (where we are today) while he tries, but to no avail, sell his new invention... The cigarette. While he plays from town to town, he believes if he becomes famous he might sell his cigarette. (he will not be able to sell them)

### Family:
Tim'Bop'McGee was raised by his elven mother, Morfir McGee, and his human father, Rodd Bop, in their large estate. Only knowing wealth and comfort, Tim
