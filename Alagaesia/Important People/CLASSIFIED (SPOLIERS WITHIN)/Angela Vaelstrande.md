### **Notes on Angela’s Nature**

Angela’s wandering presence near pivotal moments suggests that her connection to history is both instinctual and mystical. She claims not to know why she is drawn to these events, often muttering that “the threads of time pull tighter here.”  
Her apparent madness may stem from the vast expanse of her memory, spanning centuries of experiences. Alternatively, it may be a ruse to keep people from prying too deeply into her true nature.

Solemnbum, her werecat, occasionally drops cryptic hints about her past and the events she’s tied to, but never enough to give anyone a clear picture. Both Angela and her companion seem to embody the intersection of chaos, destiny, and the unknown.
