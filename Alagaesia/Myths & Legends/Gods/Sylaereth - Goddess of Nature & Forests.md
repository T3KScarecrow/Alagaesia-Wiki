Sylaereth is the Elf goddess of nature, flora, and fauna. Believed by the Elves to be the embodiment of Du Weldenvarden itself, Sylaereth is said to sleep beneath the forest, her dreams giving life to the enchanted woods. Almost all Elves who reside within the Great Forest worship her, as through her influence and forests do the Elves draw their power, power that the Elves use to strengthen and enchant the forest, in a form of divine symbiosis. Sylaereth is depicted as a woman made of intertwining vines, her symbol is a leaf-shaped amulet.
