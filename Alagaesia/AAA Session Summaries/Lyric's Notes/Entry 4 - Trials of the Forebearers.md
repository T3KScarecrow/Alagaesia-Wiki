[[The Forebearers|The Forebearer]] dungeon is a marvel beyond words. The ancient carvings and scripture speak of a time and culture so distant yet so profound. Translating these texts filled me with a sense of purpose I haven’t felt in years.

The trials within, however, were gruelling. The puzzle of the glyphs and pots confounded us for hours until [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] and I pieced it together. The Chamber of Tides tested not only our intellect but our patience. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper’s]] mischief and [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron’s]] antics—such as throwing a healing potion at a golem in what I can only assume was a misguided gesture of diplomacy—did little to help.

I took solace during our short rest in a conversation with [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]]. His faith in [[vi|Vitalas]] is unwavering, almost enviable. We spoke of the Forebearers, their faith, and what their fall might teach us. His kindness and wisdom are a balm, though I remain sceptical of gods and their plans.

For now, I steel myself for what lies ahead. These ruins hold secrets I am desperate to uncover, though I fear what we might awaken in our pursuit.
