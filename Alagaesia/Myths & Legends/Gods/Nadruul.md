The god of undeath and false redemption is known as **Nadruul, the Decaying Promise**.

### **Nadruul, the Decaying Promise**

Nadruul is the god of undeath, false redemption, and cursed immortality. Depicted as a towering figure cloaked in shadow and rot, they are said to have once been a powerful being who sought the secrets of eternal life. In their pursuit, Nadruul defied the natural order, breaking the sacred cycle of life and death. Now, they exist in a state of eternal decay, neither fully alive nor dead, and they offer this twisted version of immortality to their followers.

### **The Promise of Immortality**
Nadruul's allure lies in their promise of eternal life, a temptation for those who fear death or seek power beyond the grave. They whisper to mortals, promising freedom from death’s grasp, offering an eternity to continue one's work, protect loved ones, or seek redemption for past sins. However, this promise comes with a sinister catch. Those who accept Nadruul’s gift do indeed live forever, but their bodies continue to decay. Over time, they rot and wither, their flesh peeling away, their bones exposed, yet they remain conscious and aware.

Followers of Nadruul, known as the **Wasted** or **The Ever-Rot**, slowly become walking corpses—immortal, but trapped in bodies that betray the passage of time. The more they resist the call of death, the further their physical form deteriorates. Nadruul tells them that this is the price of ultimate power, that their suffering is the "cost of redemption," and that only through enduring the decay will they achieve true transcendence. But no matter how much their followers decay, true redemption or release never comes, and the faithful are forever bound to the physical world in a state of endless ruin.

### **Domains and Symbolism**
Nadruul's domains include **undeath**, **corruption**, **false hope**, and **decay**. Their presence is often marked by the sickly-sweet smell of rot, and their followers use necromantic magic to extend their own lives or raise the dead as servants. They dwell in tomb-like temples filled with moldering bones and crumbling walls, where they meditate on the nature of life, death, and their god’s twisted teachings.

The symbol of Nadruul is a **decaying crown**, half covered in crumbling flesh, with bones jutting out. It represents both the false grandeur of immortality and the inevitable rot that comes with it. Shrines to Nadruul are often built in crypts or abandoned places, where followers pray for the strength to endure their undeath.

### **Nadruul’s Worshippers**
Those who seek out Nadruul are often the desperate: people on the brink of death, those who wish to evade judgment, or power-hungry individuals seeking eternity at any cost. Many begin their worship believing they can outsmart the catch or that they will find a way to reverse the decay. However, as their bodies wither, they become more reliant on Nadruul’s power, trapped in an endless cycle of seeking salvation that never comes. 

While most see Nadruul as a cursed god, some of their followers consider themselves blessed, believing that their undying existence grants them a form of twisted enlightenment—a chance to witness centuries of history and wisdom, albeit in a form that slowly crumbles.

Nadruul remains an unsettling figure in this world, offering the allure of immortality, but trapping their followers in an eternity of rot, where death would be a mercy.
