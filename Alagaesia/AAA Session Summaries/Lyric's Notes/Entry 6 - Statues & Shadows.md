The moonlit chamber was no less foreboding. At first, its serene glow offered comfort, but the puzzle it hid tested us in ways I did not expect. The dials seemed harmlessâ€”until the statues moved. [[Wiate Wight|Wiate]], ever defiant, pushed the limits and awakened them. The ensuing battle was chaos.

I... was not prepared. My attempts to avoid their relentless strikes were met with mixed success. The others fought valiantly, their strength and skill shining where mine faltered. I saw the way [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] and [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] worked together to destroy those stone monstrosities. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper]], from his perch above, lent his precision, while [[Alagaesia/Important People/Michael|Michael]] brought his calm determination to solving the puzzle.

In the end, it was the moons that saved us, their phases unlocking the room's secrets. But I cannot shake the shame of my own helplessness.
