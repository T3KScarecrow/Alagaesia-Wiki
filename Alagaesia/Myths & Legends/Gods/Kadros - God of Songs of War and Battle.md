Kadros is the [[The Humans|Human]] god of war, courage, honour and glory, and is the sister to Kaelyra. Kadros inspires warriors through songs that stir their hearts and steel their resolve. His melodies are thunderous, brimming with tales of valour and the clash of steel. He believes that conflict is a proving ground for strength and his songs a means of capturing history, but his songs also honour the fallen, preserving their deeds for eternity.

Kadros is depicted as a bardic warrior with a crimson cloak and a battle-worn lute strapped to his back, wielding it both as an instrument and weapon. Statues of Kadros often show him standing on a battlefield, his head thrown back in song.

When Kadros walks among mortals, he appears as a muscular man with fiery auburn hair and eyes that burn like embers. His voice is deep and resonant, with a power that can inspire armies to charge or bring tears to even the most hardened warriors. His lute, "Thundersong", resonates with the clamour of battle, and his armour gleans with runes of protection.

Kadros is said by some to have been born from the first war cry, and his songs are said to have echoed during humanity's earliest battles. Others say he was born as a mortal, and he and his sister played a song to the gods so legendary, that theyLegends tell of his appearances during great conflicts, where his presence turned the tide of war. His hymns are often sung by soldiers before battle, and his temples are adorned with banners of victorious armies.
