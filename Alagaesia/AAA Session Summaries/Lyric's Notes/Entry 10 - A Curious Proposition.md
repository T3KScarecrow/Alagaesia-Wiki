Today began with promise. After receiving our payment from the [[The Great Museum Of Arcane History|MoAH]], we found ourselves free to wander [[Caelora]]. [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] and [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] decided to visit the blacksmith, and I, eager to further my studies of weapon craftsmanship, joined them. Watching [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel's]] mace get sharpened and [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron's]] greatsword upgraded was oddly fascinating. The blacksmith's infusion process was masterfulâ€”so precise, so deliberate. It sparked an idea in me: could we register as an adventuring party with the [[Adventurers Guild|Adventurers' Guild]]? Could we use our own somewhat proficiency with adventuring to our advantage? The thought excited me. Such an affiliation would open up opportunities to take on meaningful contracts, solve mysteries, and perhaps uncover more [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] relics.

Little did I know how swiftly the day would take a chaotic turn.
