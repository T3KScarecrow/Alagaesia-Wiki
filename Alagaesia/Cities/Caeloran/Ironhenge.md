Ironhenge, in the heart of [[Caelora]], is a gritty industrial powerhouse where the constant sounds of hammer on anvil echo from dawn till dusk. Known for its expertise in metallurgy, the city is covered in a haze of smoke and ash from its countless forges and furnaces. The buildings, made of dark stone and reinforced with iron bands, are stacked closely together, with narrow, winding streets connecting workshops, warehouses, and apprentices’ quarters. The city itself appears to have grown organically around its forges, with towering chimneys, metal-laden bridges, and rail systems designed to transport raw materials and finished products efficiently.

At the heart of Ironhenge lies **The Forge Spire**, a towering, blackened structure housing the city’s grandest forge. Here, master smiths craft exquisite arms and armour, renowned for their durability and craftsmanship. Around the Forge Spire are rows of workshops, each run by a different guild or smithing master, with apprentices bustling between them, eager to learn the trade. Ironhenge’s export focus is on weaponry and armour, producing everything from swords, axes, and shields to heavy plate armour that has earned a reputation for unmatched quality. The city exports to many Vulgomage factions, and even some Enlightened lands, though at a heavy profit.

**Ironhenge's Leadership** is held by **Lord Merric Asherthorn**, a nobleman driven by profit and lacking in the wisdom or restraint his position demands. Asherthorn is largely motivated by wealth, holding more interest in maintaining and increasing the city’s output than the well-being of his workers or apprentices. His council, a body of wealthy shareholders and business magnates, influences much of Ironhenge’s direction. These “advisers” operate as if the city is a business rather than a home. Most of these advisers reside in **Horizon’s Edge**, the bustling port city of Thalassara, where they conduct lucrative trade deals and oversee Ironhenge’s exports.

Ironhenge’s populace is a mix of skilled smiths, dedicated apprentices, and hardened laborers, most of whom rely on their craft to make a living. The city’s apprenticeships are highly competitive, with hopefuls arriving from across Caelora, each aiming to be taken under the wing of a master smith. Many work under harsh conditions, with long hours and scarce rest, as the demand for Ironhenge’s goods keeps every forge burning day and night. Despite this, pride in craftsmanship runs deep, and the smiths of Ironhenge are highly respected. Some of the most skilled artisans have private, guarded forges in back alleys or hidden workshops, where they work on unique, personalized commissions.

The **Ashen Market** near the Forge Spire serves as a central hub, where merchants and smiths haggle over metal, ore, and precious stones, while traders hawk food and drink to the weary workers. The market is alive with the sounds of barter, and occasionally one can spot foreign buyers and emissaries seeking to procure Ironhenge’s finest wares for distant realms. For those who manage to earn it, Ironhenge is not only a place of unyielding industry but of fierce pride—a testament to the Vulgomage’s craftsmanship and resilience.
