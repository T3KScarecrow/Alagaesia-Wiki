Our departure from [[Caelora]] began with chaos. [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]], in what I can only describe as a fit of defiance, caused such a commotion at the Silver Quill Tavern that I was nearly turned away at the door! Were it not for [[Natalie Porter|Natalie’s]] intervention, I might still be standing outside, embarrassed and bewildered.

Later, as we made camp, [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] forcefully rifled through my belongings. My journal, my notes—my work scattered like autumn leaves! To make matters worse, he unintentionally triggered a Fireball scroll, nearly roasting us all alive. I escaped with singed nerves and my dignity in tatters, though [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] was kind enough to mend what damage he could.

Despite [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron’s]] lack of tact or care, the others have shown themselves to be steadfast and capable. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel’s]] quiet reverence for his god, [[Alagaesia/Important People/Michael|Michael’s]] unwavering vigilance, and [[Natalie Porter|Natalie’s]] leadership are reassuring. I find myself cautiously optimistic, though I still feel a growing unease toward our Warforged companion.
