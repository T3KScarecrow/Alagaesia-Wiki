### The Iron Vow Mercenary Company

**Symbol/Banner:** The Iron Vow’s banner is a dark, steel-grey field with a crimson gauntlet holding a broken sword, symbolizing both unyielding resolve and the idea that they will take on the most desperate of tasks. The banner is outlined in gold trim, signifying the wealth and reputation they have accrued.

### **Structure and Organization:**
The Iron Vow Mercenary Company is led by a council of captains known as the *Iron Circle*, consisting of seven veteran warriors and mages, each with their own storied history in battle. Below the Iron Circle are the *Vowbearers*, seasoned commanders who lead squads into battle or on missions. The bulk of the company is made up of *Vanguards*, who are the battle-hardened rank-and-file soldiers, and *Iron Adepts*, spellcasters who support with magic, from basic enchantments to devastating combat spells.

The company is divided into smaller units, each known as a *Blade*, specializing in different tasks: the *Shadowblades* for covert operations, *Iron Guard* for heavy combat, and *Silver Tongues* for negotiations and espionage. Each Blade wears distinct insignia to signify their division, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in their operations.

### **Composition:**
While predominantly human, The Iron Vow is known for its diversity. They value skill over heritage, and as such, have orcish berserkers whose battle cries can rally a legion, dwarven tacticians who strategize with precision, and the rare elf who brings unmatched agility and centuries of wisdom. Goblins are occasionally recruited as scouts or sabotage experts, their cunning proving valuable in less conventional missions.

### **Important Members:**
- **Garran Steelheart** – The iron-willed leader of the Iron Circle, known for his tactical genius and unyielding loyalty to his mercenaries. Garran has a prosthetic iron arm, the result of a battle against a warlock cabal that left him scarred but not broken.
- **Velara the Nightshade** – Captain of the Shadowblades, an enigmatic half-elf who wields both blade and shadow magic with deadly precision. Her whispers are said to unravel enemy plans before battles even begin.
- **Thulgrin Emberforge** – The dwarven master smith who crafts and maintains the iconic enchanted armour and weapons of the company, ensuring they are always battle-ready.
- **Kargoth One-Eye** – An orc Vowbearer who has earned his place in legend for his berserk fury and unmatched strength in the heat of battle. Despite his fearsome reputation, Kargoth is known for mentoring new recruits.

### **History and Reputation:**
The Iron Vow was founded over 300 years ago by mercenaries seeking more than coin—they swore oaths to defend one another and uphold a code of loyalty and efficacy. This code transformed them from a band of sellswords into an esteemed company whose services were sought by kings and warlords alike. Their origin traces back to Caelora, where they were hired by various noble houses to settle disputes. Over time, their operations expanded to border skirmishes, sieges, and even monster-hunting for cities besieged by aberrant threats. The Iron Vow is one of the [[Adventurers Guild|Adventurers' Guild's]] longest serving companies.

Despite their fame, The Iron Vow maintains a strict rule against engaging in wanton slaughter or serving causes that bring undue harm to innocents. This moral code has earned them both admiration and enemies, particularly from factions who view them as obstacles.

### **Acts of Renown:**
- **The Siege of Ironfell** – The Iron Vow held off an invading army five times their size, allowing the residents of Ironfell to evacuate. They became legends in the north after this act of valor.
- **The Crowned Betrayal** – They once turned against a client, a power-hungry duke who sought to annihilate an entire village of innocents. This moment cemented their reputation as mercenaries who, while dangerous, would not sacrifice honour for gold.
- **The Hunt for the Storm Serpent** – The company’s mages and warriors united to slay a titanic sea serpent that plagued the eastern coasts, a feat that won them recognition across multiple kingdoms.

### **Acts of Loyalty and Tradition:**
When a mercenary joins The Iron Vow, they must make a binding pledge on an enchanted iron gauntlet—a ritual that, it is said, binds their will to the ideals of the company. Betrayal of this oath results in expulsion, often in combat trials that the traitor rarely survives.

### **Reputation and Banner Recognition:**
The sight of The Iron Vow's crimson gauntlet banner strikes both fear and hope. For those in need, it is a symbol of salvation. For those who oppose them, it is a herald of inevitable, uncompromising battle.
