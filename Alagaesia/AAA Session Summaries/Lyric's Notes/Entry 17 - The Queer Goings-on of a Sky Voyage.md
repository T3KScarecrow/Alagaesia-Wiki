I must admit, I never imagined I would be flying through the sky aboard a grand sky-ship like the Sky Voyager, but life has a way of surprising me. Percy Thaliarchus was kind enough to bestow upon us priority tickets, allowing us swift passage to Falshire, and given the urgency of our mission, it seemed the best course of action. As exhilarating as it is, my excitement is tempered by the weight of our task—Dr. Mortan Leywick, Lord Taviel, and his daughter are missing, and we are to retrieve the doctor, or at the very least, his research. A serious undertaking, and yet, the voyage itself was anything but.

Gabriel spent much of the time engrossed in his mysterious orb, which, as it turns out, is no mere trinket but an Orb of Omens—a relic of divine craftsmanship, apparently capable of revealing past events lost to time. The Captain, a peculiar but oddly likable old sailor, seemed unfazed by the revelation, speaking of it as if it were just another day’s discovery. I wonder what kind of life he must have led to take such things in stride.

Natalie, ever the enigma, spent a concerning amount of time conducting what I can only describe as experiments on a magical satchel she acquired from Angela. Every meal, Aaron’s unfortunate excuse for food was placed into the bag and vanished—teleported away to an unknown destination. For what purpose, I cannot say, but she seems determined to understand the process. I fear for whomever (or whatever) may be receiving those deliveries.

Vesper, meanwhile, took to his usual antics, pilfering small items and spreading rumours amoung the crew, weaving elaborate tales of supposed thefts and misplaced affections. I would call it mischief, but there’s an artistry to it, a craft to his deception. If not for the nature of our work, I might find myself more worried about his inclinations.

Then there is Aaron.

At first, it was merely inconvenient: his attempt to steal the ship’s only toilet, for reasons I refuse to try and understand. The Captain, of course, was utterly unfazed by this, simply inquiring if Aaron was using it before proceeding to do so himself.

But the worst came when Aaron, under the pretense of learning navigation, was allowed into the cockpit. He noticed a large red button labeled "DO NOT TOUCH" and, with only the Captain’s vague encouragement, immediately pressed it. For a moment, I feared disaster—plummeting from the sky, some kind of explosive release, or gods know what else. Instead, a cabinet slid open to reveal a fresh cup of steaming Scholar’s Brew. The Captain downed it with gratitude, and just like that, we were back to normal.

Perhaps Aaron’s greatest takeaway from this entire journey is his newfound appreciation for Scholar's Brew. Small victories, I suppose.

As the Sky Voyager lowers its rope ladder, I find my anticipation rising. Falshire awaits, and with it, our true challenge.
