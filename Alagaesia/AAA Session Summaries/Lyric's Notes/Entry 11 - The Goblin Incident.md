I do not know what possessed Aaron, but as soon as we entered the Adventurers' Guild, he fixated on the receptionist—a goblin, impeccably dressed—and in a fit of inexplicable rage, dragged him outside. The chaos that ensued is difficult to put into words. Dozens, no, _hundreds_ of adventurers leapt into action, their wrath ignited by Aaron’s actions.

Gabriel and I had no choice but to step aside as the tide of fury poured from the tavern through the building's doors. We watched in stunned silence as Aaron threw the goblin back inside, then fled down the street, pursued by a small army. Amid this chaos, I noticed a single man, composed and elegant, still seated at the bar. He was dressed impeccably, his grey goatee and moustache groomed to perfection. Calmly, he wiped his mouth, then vanished into thin air. Moments later, Aaron was magically dragged back into the Guild by this same man, a wizard named Geoffrey.

What followed was a masterclass in quiet authority. Geoffrey made Aaron apologize (or at least tried), and when Aaron refused, he teleported him away. It seems our warforged friend will spend the next three nights in a Caeloran jail.
