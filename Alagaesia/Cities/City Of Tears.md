The **City of Tears** was once known as **Illumëthil**, a radiant beacon of learning, artistry, and magical innovation in the time of the Forebearers. Built atop a serene lake, its central spire, the **Celestial Obelisk**, reached toward the heavens, channelling arcane energies from the stars themselves. This city was not only a centre of magical knowledge but also a hub of diplomacy where elves, dwarves, and even the earliest humans were welcomed to exchange wisdom.

Before the Fall, Illumëthil was renowned for its **Singing Fountains**, enchanted waterways that produced harmonious music as water cascaded through crystal structures. These fountains, created by Forebearer artificers, filled the city with melodies that changed with the seasons, reflecting the joy and peace that radiated from its inhabitants. It was a place where the boundaries between the arcane and the mundane blurred, with clockwork golems tending to daily tasks and the skies alive with flying constructs.

The Fall, however, shattered this peace. On the night of the Fall, without warning, the city was beset by a cataclysmic event. Some say the stars aligned in a cursed formation; others believe a terrible betrayal from within caused the city's downfall. What is known is that a **great storm** arose over Illumëthil, darkening the skies and turning the lake beneath it black as ink. The fountains, which once sang with life, began to weep an endless stream of water, overflowing their bounds. When the storm passed, the city was empty—silent, except for the sound of the weeping fountains.

Now called the **City of Tears**, the once-glorious structures lie in ruin, overtaken by moss and creeping vines. The once-glimmering lake is now a mournful bog, and the fountains no longer produce music—only an unending, haunting flow of water that echoes through the abandoned streets. Travelers and scholars who visit the city are said to hear the faint sounds of sobbing in the wind, as if the city itself mourns the loss of its people.

Legends say that **Illumëthil’s fall** was so traumatic that even the arcane constructs within the city were affected. The few remaining golems, once majestic creations, now wander aimlessly, their tasks long forgotten. The **Celestial Obelisk**, once a marvel of magical engineering, still stands, but it no longer shines with the same brilliance. It has become a symbol of the city's grief, its power dimmed but not extinguished.

Thus, the City of Tears stands as a haunting reminder of the lost glory of the Forebearers, a place where sorrow is woven into every stone.
