#### From "Terrors And Spooks that Might be True" by Beatrisa Wynstone
Everyone has some level of understanding on how Bags of Holding and other such magic items work; they are connected to some form of plane different to our own, and each Bag connects to its own one. It must work like this, otherwise what would be stopping someone from taking stuff out of their Bag only to find that the stuff was not theirs, and actually came from another Bag? What if they *are* connected in some way? Some tell tales of an entity, not quite man, who lives inside of the Bags of Holding. The Bagman is a tall and horrendously lanky being. Their skin is taut against their bones and little muscle, and glistens with an undead lustre. Jutting out of a human head, the Bagman's grotesquely mismatched teeth sit, only some human. The rest a hideous combination of orc, wolf, even bear. The Bagman sustains themself on the food adventurers unsuspectingly drop into their Bag of Holding. But when that food runs dry, the Bagman waits until the adventurers are fast asleep, all cozy in their cots, and emerges. They slide their way out from the Bag, and snatch up an adventurer or two with strength inhuman, and scurry their way back into their domain to eat their newfound meal.
