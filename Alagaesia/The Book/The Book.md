A man, not quite Elven nor wholly Human, wearing **ROBES** and a **PENDANT** stood in the street checking a note. 

*Gabriel **SOMETHING** of **SOMETHING CHURCHY**                  13th Marcion 1342
I hope this letter finds you well.
After an intense combing through of candidates, the Grand Museum Of Arcane History
is glad to welcome you into its newest initiative. For your convenience, you shall find accommodation at the Silver Quill Tavern, paid for by the MOAH. Please arrive at the MOAH 
on the 14th at midday to meet your partymates and for more instructions.

*Professionally,
Lasscial Vaelithar*

Gabriel pocketed the small letter and looked around the street. He had only been in Caelora City for a short while now, and had rarely explored the Guild District. It had taken him twenty minutes to find the Silver Quill, and reasoned that the Museum would choose the closest tavern to serve the members of its "newest initiative". Gabriel did not know much about the job he had signed up for, but what he did know was thus; he would be joining a contracted group of adventurers, and would be travelling across much of Caldoran. Gabriel did not care much himself for adventuring or those who partake in it. He had signed up in pursuit of the knowledge he might uncover. After another twenty or so minutes of wandering, Gabriel saw them; the grandiose marble pillars, the ancient-inspired architecture, a group of curiously dressed individuals standing out the front, each unique from the others. Gabriel approached the group, assessing them as he neared: A menacing Automaton who seemed tall in posture and presence yet is only average in height. The almost-midday sun glinted magically off its intricate dark steel armour-skin. Gabriel couldn't make out a symbol indented in its shoulder. A fit and slender Human woman, a warrior or soldier no doubt with straight shoulder-length, dirt coloured hair, a weary expression in her eyes. A large, stocky and muscular Human man who wore a holy pendant of his own; *Nahzu*. Gabriel made a mental note. And finally, a similarly tall Human man, although a stark contrast to the prior with his wiry and academic demeanour. 

"Greetings. I assume you all are here for the MOAH job?" queried Gabriel.
The woman was the one to answer. "Yes. I am Natalie Porter"
"Gabriel." The two shook hands.
"Ah, another holy man, I see!" The muscular man took Gabriel's hand into a firm shake, "Michael's the name."
"A pleasure." replied Gabriel after he extricated his hand from the too-long greeting.
"Hello. I am Wiate." The more scholarly man proffered. Another handshake ensued.
Gabriel looked at the Automaton. When it did not acknowledge him, he asked "Does it have a name?"
"Yes, I in fact do, heretic." Its voice was low in pitch but not in volume, and it spat out the last word.
"My apologies. I meant no offence..." Gabriel waited for a name which did not come.
"Aaron. It said its name was Aaron. When Michael arrived, Mr Metal stopped talking." Natalie explained.
"Yeah"
