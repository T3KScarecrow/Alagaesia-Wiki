Returning to [[Caelora]], I was greeted by the kind smile of an old friend at the [[The Great Museum Of Arcane History|Museum]]. For a moment, her gentle words and keen interest in our tale made me forget the ache in my body and the shame in my heart. But [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron's]] bluntness brought me crashing back to reality. He demanded payment, citing my failures as justification for more.

[[Lasscial]], ever poised and precise, handed over the gold without hesitation, though his gaze lingered on me with thinly veiled disdain. I fear I have much to proveâ€”not just to my companions, but to myself.

I wonder what the coming days will hold. Perhaps in the archives of the [[The Great Museum Of Arcane History|Museum]], I will find solace and strength. For now, I will carry on. I must.
