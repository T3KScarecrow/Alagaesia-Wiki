Our journey was interrupted by the arrival of Vesper, the final member of our company. His charm and quick wit were a refreshing contrast to the trials we’ve faced thus far. He arrived astride a stolen horse named Frank—a questionable decision, though I suppose one must admire his resourcefulness.

The goblin ambush that followed was my first taste of true danger. I confess, I am ill-suited for combat. The chaos of the skirmish left me breathless, clinging to the safety of the cart while my companions fought valiantly. Even Aaron, for all his bluster, proved an indomitable force on the battlefield.

Afterward, I could not help but marvel at the resilience of those around me. Gabriel’s healing hands, Michael’s shield raised high, Natalie’s sword flashing in the firelight—all painted a portrait of heroism that left me in awe.
