Everyone has some level of understanding on how Bags of Holding and other such magic items work; they are connected to some form of plane different to our own, and each Bag connects to its own one. It must work like this, otherwise what would be stopping someone from taking stuff out of their Bag only to find that the stuff was not theirs, and actually came from another Bag? What if they *are* connected in some way?
