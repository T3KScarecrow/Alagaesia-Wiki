#### From _"Celestial Myths & Divine Histories"_ by Loremaster Caelwyn Eltharion

Long before Khonshu’s rise to power as the god of the moon, before his wisdom and his realm stretched across the heavens, he was known only as the lesser god of justice and retribution. His domain was simple: to enforce the balance between light and dark, to carry out the will of higher powers, and to ensure that no crime, no injustice, went unanswered in the mortal realm.

In the same primordial epoch, Nadruul, the god of undeath and false redemption, made his presence known in the cosmos. Where Khonshu sought balance, Nadruul sought corruption, the twisting of life into death, the deceiving of souls into an unnatural second chance—a false hope that death itself could be overcome. Unlike Khonshu, whose actions were bound by a strict moral code, Nadruul’s nature was one of seduction and manipulation, offering the illusion of redemption in exchange for the souls of the desperate and the damned.

Their paths were fated to cross, for though their motives diverged, their actions often led them into conflict. Khonshu, ever the enforcer of justice, could not abide by the idea of souls being led astray by the false promises of Nadruul. And Nadruul, in turn, saw Khonshu’s blind sense of righteousness as an obstacle to his greater goals of subverting the natural order and spreading his influence over the mortal realm.

It was on a cold, moonless night that their clash began, beneath the vast heavens where stars were yet mere embers in the sky. Nadruul, in his form as a shifting shadow, moved across the land, gathering souls who had died in dishonour or despair. With whispered words, he tempted them, offering them a chance at life again, but only if they would bind themselves to him in servitude for eternity. In his wake, the earth grew still, the air grew thick with the stench of decay, and the very world seemed to wither beneath his influence.

Khonshu, sensing this unnatural disturbance in the balance of the world, rose from his place in the celestial realms. Though he was still a god of lesser renown, his sense of justice burned bright, and he would not allow Nadruul’s dark machinations to go unchecked. The moon did not shine this night, and the air was heavy with the weight of unfulfilled justice.

Khonshu descended from the heavens, his form bathed in the cold, pale light of the stars, his eyes gleaming with the promise of swift retribution. He found Nadruul in the mortal world, surrounded by his thralls—souls twisted by the false promises of redemption, walking in a half-dead state, bound to the god’s will.

“Nadruul,” Khonshu called out, his voice like the echo of a distant thunderclap. “You defile the natural order with your lies. These souls are not meant to return from death. You twist their essence for your own gain, and I will not allow it.”

Nadruul turned to face him, his form a shifting mass of shadow, his eyes burning with the intensity of a thousand dying stars. A cruel, hollow smile spread across his face, and he spoke in a voice that seemed to slither like the wind through the dead trees.

“Khonshu, god of justice,” Nadruul said, his voice dripping with mockery. “You who seek balance and righteousness, how naïve you are. These souls desire what I offer—release from their torment, freedom from the fear of death. You are bound by your rules, but I… I offer them the true power they seek. You would deny them their salvation for the sake of your petty code?”

Khonshu’s gaze hardened, his fists clenching at his sides. “Salvation? You offer only damnation. You take from them their very essence, chaining them to your will for eternity. You deceive them with false hope, and I will not stand by and watch.”

And with that, the two gods clashed. Khonshu’s form shone with the brilliance of the moonless sky, his power rooted in the strength of retribution. Nadruul, on the other hand, was an embodiment of decay and manipulation, his power rising from the darkest corners of death itself.

The battle was fierce, each god matching the other’s power with their own. Khonshu struck with swift and precise blows, his justice cleaving through the air like the sharpest of blades. Nadruul, however, was a slippery foe, his shadowy form twisting and shifting, evading Khonshu’s strikes and countering with illusions that threatened to ensnare the lesser god’s mind.

For hours, the battle raged, with Khonshu’s cold fury clashing against Nadruul’s cunning deceit. The ground beneath them cracked and crumbled, the air itself growing heavy with the weight of their conflict. Yet despite the violence of their struggle, neither could gain the upper hand. Khonshu’s retribution was swift, but Nadruul’s deceptions were endless.

In the end, it was not strength that decided their clash, but wisdom. Khonshu, recognizing the true nature of Nadruul’s power, turned the tide of the battle with a sudden, unanticipated move. Rather than continuing to attack, he called upon the balance of the cosmos, the eternal forces that governed life and death.

“You speak of redemption, Nadruul,” Khonshu said, his voice now firm with the weight of ancient knowledge. “But redemption cannot be found in the dead. It must be sought in the living, in the heart of those who have yet to fall.”

With those words, Khonshu invoked the ancient laws of the universe, the very forces that bound life and death together. Nadruul’s power, rooted in the twisting of death and undeath, faltered for a moment, as the divine balance temporarily pushed against him. In that fleeting instant, Khonshu struck, not with violence, but with a power that turned Nadruul’s own essence back upon itself.

Nadruul screamed in fury and agony as his hold over the thralls weakened, their souls slipping from his grasp. Khonshu, victorious but weary, watched as the shadowy god recoiled into the void, defeated but not destroyed.

“I have not conquered you, Nadruul,” Khonshu said solemnly, his gaze lingering on the retreating god. “But know this: the night may be long, and death may seem endless, but there are forces greater than both. You will never hold sway over the balance of life and death.”

Nadruul, his form fading into the abyss, muttered a final curse. “This is not the end, Khonshu. You may have won this battle, but the war is far from over. The shadow will rise again.”

And so, with a final whisper of defiance, Nadruul vanished into the darkness, his influence receding for the time being. Khonshu, though victorious, knew that this was only one chapter in a much greater tale of light and shadow, justice and corruption. He would remain vigilant, ever ready to enforce the balance, knowing that Nadruul would rise again—but not without challenge.

And thus, the tale of Khonshu and Nadruul became legend—a reminder that even the greatest gods are bound by the forces of the cosmos, and that the battle between light and dark, life and death, is eternal.
