Bartholomew is a Warforged, created by an old farmer artificer to be a farmhand. In the last expansion of the Enlightened, Enlightened knights swept through a small farm, where they were met by Bartholomew's creator who tried to fend them off of his land. The knights made swift work of the frail man, and set the farm ablaze. One of the knights found Bartholomew, and saw great potential in him, to serve the cause. Bartholomew was taken in by the Enlightened, where he was taught to hate those who do not worship the One True God.
