### Chapter 1: The Silver Quill

A man, not quite Elven nor wholly Human, wearing **ROBES DESCRIPTION** and a **PENDANT DESCRIPTION** stood in the cobblestone street checking a piece of parchment. 

*Gabriel **SOMETHING** of **SOMETHING CHURCHY**                  13th Marcion 1342
I hope this letter finds you well.
After an intense combing through of candidates, the Grand Museum Of Arcane History
is glad to welcome you into its newest initiative. For your convenience, you shall find accommodation at the Silver Quill tavern, paid for by the MoAH. Please arrive at the MoAH 
on the 14th at midday to meet your partymates and for more instructions.*

*Professionally,
Lasscial Vaelithar*

Gabriel pocketed the small letter and looked around the street. He had only been in Caelora City for a short while now, and had rarely explored the Guild District. It had taken him twenty minutes to find the Silver Quill, and reasoned that the Museum would choose the closest tavern to serve the members of its "newest initiative". Gabriel did not know much about the job he had signed up for, but what he did know was thus; he would be joining a contracted group of adventurers, and would be travelling across much of Caldoran. Gabriel did not care much himself for adventuring or those who partake in it. He had signed up in pursuit of the knowledge he might uncover. After another twenty or so minutes of wandering, Gabriel saw them; the grandiose marble pillars, the ancient-inspired architecture, a group of curiously dressed individuals standing out the front, each unique from the others. Gabriel approached the group, assessing them as he neared: A menacing Automaton who seemed grand in posture and presence yet was only average in height. The almost-midday sun glinted magically off its intricate dark steel armour-skin. Gabriel couldn't make out a symbol indented in its shoulder. A fit and slender Human woman, a warrior or soldier no doubt with straight shoulder-length, dirt coloured hair, a weary expression in her eyes. A large, stocky and muscular Human man who wore a holy pendant of his own; 
*Nahzu*. Gabriel made a mental note. And finally, a similarly tall Human man, although a stark contrast to the prior with his wiry and intelligent demeanour. 

"Greetings. I assume you all are here for the MoAH job?" queried Gabriel.
The group tilted their heads slightly at his accent. The woman was the one to answer.
"Yes. I am Natalie Porter"
"Gabriel." The two shook hands.
"Ah, another holy man, I see!" The muscular man took Gabriel's hand into a firm shake. "Michael's the name."
"A pleasure." replied Gabriel after he extricated his hand from the too-long greeting.
"Hello. I am Wiate." The more scholarly man proffered. Another handshake ensued.
Gabriel looked at the Automaton. When it did not acknowledge him, he asked "Does it have a name?"
"Yes, I in fact do, heretic." Its voice was barely artificial sounding and low in pitch but not in volume, the last word spat out.
"My apologies. I meant no offence..." Gabriel waited for a name which did not come.
"Aaron. It said its name was Aaron. When Michael arrived, Mr Metal stopped talking." Natalie explained.
"Yeah. I never knew a hunk of metal to have such an attitude." Michael laughed heartily.
"You bite your tongue, Moonprayer, or I'll smash your head against the cobblestone!" Aaron spoke with much venom. After a few minutes in an awkward silence, the tension too high to speak, a small yet proper voice announced behind them. 
"Good day, adventurers! I - um, I am Lyric Alderwyn. I shall be your liaison to the MoAH and guide." Upon tracing the voice back to its origin, the group were presented with a small, very well dressed, scholarly Elf. He seemed to be young for an Elf. Everything about his appearance screamed he was not one for adventure; his neatly combed chestnut hair, his circular copper-rimmed glasses, his lithe form, and his high-collared, cream-coloured tunic, and tailored vest. *At least I'll have someone to talk to*, Gabriel thought to himself.

Lyric guided the group to the Silver Quill, where inside he explained the party's role and first mission. The party took in the tavern as Lyric spoke. The main word that came to mind was "cheap". The Silver Quill definitely did not put the MoAH out of pocket. It served as a place for scholars and historians and cartographers of the nearby Museum to get a drink, usually of tea or a special warm brew which invigorated its drinker, and study books or maps or even ancient artefacts. It was not a place for warriors, or thieves...*or us*. Gabriel looked to his partymates. If they felt out of place, they did not show it. In fact, they did not seem to care whatsoever. Natalie, a soldier, was probably used to worse. Michael, a man of seemingly few thoughts, would not have the faculties to care. Aaron was an artificial servant. But Wiate, Gabriel could not figure out. He was different, yet Gabriel did not know how. At a booth, Lyric went on to describe the mission.
"Long ago, there was this civilisation, brothers and sisters to the Elves, called the Forebearers. Well, that's what we call them, nobody remembers what they called themselves. Anyway, they were a race of artificers and magical, mechanical artisans. They learnt the secrets of magic and the world, and used them to create wonders the like you have never seen. That is, until they Fell. No one knows what actually happened, or if any do, they are sworn to secrecy. This is the MoAH's mission. They seek to excavate the forgotten history of this ancient people, but they can't do it alone. You see, the MoAH is all historians and academics, like me. We can't go trouncing across the wilderness, into the Wilds, chasing unfounded rumours. That would be a waste of precious research time, let alone dangerous. This is where you five come in."

Under his breath and quite enough for no one to hear, Lyric sibilated,
"Five? I could have sworn to the Gods there was supposed to be six." Lyric quietly recounted.
Natalie, Wiate, and Gabriel all sat in thinking silence, processing this information.
"So we are hired swords to be sent out into the forest and across the lands in search of ancient loot?" Michael demanded, almost angrily.
"Fantastic! I love me a good treasure and the chance to protect travellers." Laughed Michael before anyone else could answer his apparent rhetoric. Gabriel caught the religious allusion Michael had made, it being a reference to the oath worshippers of the Moon God of Justice, Nahzu swear. Gabriel did not know much of the other religions of the world, focussing his studies mainly on his, his being the Goddess of Healing and Compassion, Vitalas. Despite this, when he had first arrived in Caelora City, he had made it a goal to learn more on as many topics as were discussed in the church's library. Thanks to his slightly closed-off upbringing, Gabriel was surprised to find there were as many Gods as he did.
"What specifically would we be doing? Investigating?" Natalie asked, leaning forward to get more of an answer out of the timid Lyric.
"Um - Well, all across the lands, there are rumours, whispers, tales told to children to stop them from playing in the woods, and so on. Some of these are well-founded. Especially in the unaligned Wilds, there are ruins, monuments, dungeons, underground temples, many of which from the time of the Forebearers. These such sites, the MoAH seeks to map and catalogue, but we can't do that if we don't know where they are, if the rumours are true. You will be going to the approximated areas where such rumoured locations lie, and then explore anything you find there, bringing with you any artefacts and information when you report back."

Natalie leaned back in her seat, slouching slightly, crossing her arms. She seemed to mull it over. Finally, Wiate spoke.
"The Wilds, you say? Will we go anyplace near Ironhenge?"
"I can't say for certain, but it's possible." 
The Automaton got up from its seat.
"I need a drink." Lyric began to respond, but Aaron walked away to the bar, not listening.
"The MoAH has paid for a few beverages and meals before your first mission." Wiate eyed Aaron as it walked away, seemingly fascinated by the design and artistry of the marvellous machinations powering it.
"And what is our first mission?" Gabriel queried.
"Yes, quite right. Okay. Some sources tell of a stone spiral staircase in the middle of nowhere. Of those who venture down the steps, many leave as corpses whose cause of death seem to be bolts of lightning. The majority who leave alive describe a dark room with a large stone door. Nothing seems to be able to open the door, no key, no amount of force. There are also murals of some kind on the walls. I hypothesise it to be some kind of Forebearer dungeon, and the source of the lightning a magical trap."
"You hypothesise?" Natalie questions, raising an eyebrow.
"Well, yes. Yous are the ones being sent to find out."

Aaron returned to the booth, this time with a large bottle of expensive wine. It not so much popped the cork off as pulled it off with its metal hand, and took a large swig.
"Much better."
"You can drink?" Gabriel asked.
"Yes. I don't need to though, if that was your next question. Same with food. I drink when I want, and I want often. It makes my....me tingle." Aaron explained, a hint a snideness to his words. Previously hidden from the brightness of the direct midday sun, Gabriel could now see lines of blue magical energy flow between the "plates" of Aaron's armour-skin, serving to split the sections up. The energy seemed to eb and flow, and after much focus, Gabriel could make out a pseudo heartbeat in the brightness of the magic. The magic sparkled slightly whenever Aaron took a swig.
"Ha! ' makes me tingle too!" Michael clapped a large hand on Aaron's back, and tried to take a swig of his own, though the bottle was pulled out of his reach.
"You're not like any Automaton I've ever seen." Gabriel mused.
"You're like every Elf I've seen." Gabriel brushed off the snide remark. Insults were not Vitalas' way.

The conversation lead into evening, and the party grew hungry. Aaron was the first to act on this sensation, abruptly standing and heading to the bar. Michael followed, eager for a nice warm roast and a mead to wash it down. He would definitely make sure to fill up before they set off.
"Would you like anything?" Natalie asked those who remained seated.
Gabriel squinted to make out the various meals displayed on the large blackboard above the bar. "I'll take a roast pork and salad, with a murky tea. Thanks."
"Got it."
"Um, - I'll take a chicken sandwich, and just water, thanks." Lyric requested. It seemed that Lyric had come here with a script, a certain amount of exposition he must have practiced reciting, and once he had run out of pre-planned responses, he was noticeably more meek.
"I'll have what Gabriel's having." Said Wiate.
"Okay, I'm going to go make sure those two buffoons don't make trouble." Natalie sigh-growled as she walked away. Natalie approached the bar to unsurprisingly already find trouble.

"For the love of Alaegor, just give me some Stormbringer!" Aaron smashed its fist down on the old, mead-varnished bar.
"Whoa, a violent drunk, eh? Shh, shh, shhhh, that's ok, take a seat, drink up." The middle-aged Human bartender ushered Aaron into a stool, and slid a glass of water into its hand. Natalie regarded the man closely, ever watchful for potential threats in case conflict arose. He had a shock of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a pair of green twinkling eyes. His lean physique and scarred hands hinted to a more outdoor previous occupation. *Guard or farmer, perhaps?* Natalie mused. He also seemed to have no idea what the Automaton was talking about. Aaron sat fuming, but said no more. Natalie relayed her partymates' meal orders and her own to the 'tender.
"Comin' roight up. That'll be, err - fifteen silver."
"Uh - We're contractors for the MoAH. I was told they had covered some meals for us." Natalie interjected.
"Ah, right. ' should've guessed, what with you unique bunch. Not hardly my usual patrons."

"Aye, we're treasure hunters!" Michael blurted out, raising a large tankard of frothy mead.
"Explorers. Rumour followers." Natalie clarified defensively.
"Ohhho, interesting. I'd love for you to bring back some tales of adventure. I'll go put those orders in with the kitchen." With that, the man disappeared into a door behind the bar, and Natalie saw a glimpse of a kitchen much better kept than anything outside it. 
"What's a "Stormbringer"?" Natalie asked the Automaton who sipped disgusted at its water.
"A drink, you Imp. Apparently they don't serve it here." A queer sound of higher pitch than its voice sounded from deep within the Automaton.
"Hic - Alaegor damn it! Hic" Aaron slammed a gauntlet against its chest, a loud clang sounded, like a hollow metal drum.
"Ha! The metal man has the 'iccups! Ha!" Michael downed the rest of his tankard and fell back into the barstool next to Aaron's.
Natalie chuckled to herself, and made her way back to the party's booth. On her way, she noticed a pair of young scholars playing a dice game of betting at one of the tables. *Jibber-Jab*.

"Orders are in. Heh, I think Aaron got the hiccups." Natalie relayed to the booth.
"Curious. We were just discussing the matter of supplies." Gabriel said, nodding to Lyric.
"Ur - yes. The MoAH has paid for a carriage, well, it's more of a wagon, and a single horse. I presume you all have your own packs or such..? If not, there is a little wiggle room in the MoAH's budget for everyone to buy some extra supplies tomorrow before we set out." Lyric explained, giving questioning looks to the booth.
"I'm all set, I believe." Natalie confirmed.
"As am I." Gabriel nodded.
Eventually, the food came, and it was exquisite. Maybe it was in comparison to the recent meals the party had had over the past weeks, or maybe the best thing about the tavern was its kitchen. Either way, Natalie, Gabriel, Wiate, and Lyric all wolfed down their meals and subsequent beverages. They would be quite energised for tomorrow, if in food comas for tonight. Michael ended up ordering his own roast duck, scarfing it down.

Early the following morning, all at varying times, the party made their way downstairs to the main tavern area. Lyric showed Wiate the energising drink, the Scholar's Brew, which helped both wake up. Michael and Aaron emerged, eyes squinting against the harsh sober light. Natalie had just bathed after going for an invigorating early morning jog to keep her lungs fit and stamina high. ~~And Gabriel made his way down after a finishing up a prayer to the Goddess Vitalas to bless the party's travels~~.
"More."
"What's that?" Wiate asked Aaron.
"I want more liquor. For the road." Aaron grumbled with conviction, before abruptly rising from the booth and sidling his way up to the bar.
"I doubt the 'tender will sell him any more." Gabriel mused.
"Probably for the best; we need our wits for the road." Natalie chimed. "Can we think of any last supplies we might need?"
"I want a waterskin, and some rope. Definitely some rope. And more alcohol." Aaron declared as they sat back down at the booth, fresh tankard in hand.
"Ok.. You'll want to head to Drellen's Wares for the rope and waterskin. I don't know a good place to by alcohol to not drink it on premises. Why, may I ask, do you want a waterskin?" Lyric informed and questioned.
"Might come in handy. Never know."
Lyric eyed Aaron suspiciously, pondering the things a grumpy artificial man could do with water.
"I think I'll go visit the Citadel of Light to put in one last prayer to Vitalas before we set off." Gabriel added after a short silence.
"Yes, I think I'll join you. I've wanted to see the inside of the Citadel for a while now."  Wiate agreed.
"I'll come too! Love me a church!" Michael interjected gleefully.
"It's settled then; I shall inspect whatever manner of transportation the MoAH has seen fit to give us. Lyric'll show me the way. Michael, Gabriel, and Wiate shall pray for our safe travels at the church of Vitalas. And Aaron will... buy a waterskin. We'll all meet up at the northern stables in two hours. Got it?" Natalie summarised.
"Aye."
"Yes."
"Fine."
"Sounds good."
"Uh, ok."
"Good."


### Chapter 2: The Magic Shop With the Cat

The party split up in groups, each in the direction of their own errands. Aaron strolled alone through the Guild District of Caelora City, taking in the many heretical displays of magic. None of these magic-wielding citizens worshipped the One True God for their powers, and thus should not dare display such outward blasphemy. One day, he'll show them the error of their ways. But not today. Today, he was looking for Drellen's Wares. After a tedious walk with much verticality, Aaron managed to find the small general goods store. The building itself was quite plain, yet well-maintained. A small weathered, wooden sign stretched out from it, displaying a sack of goods. A few crates and barrels were neatly stacked outside. Aaron scoffed to himself before entering. Inside, shelves overflowed with mundane supplies, from rope and lanterns to rations and parchment. Further into the store sat a wooden counter, cluttered with ledgers, quills, and a bell for service. If Aaron had a nose, he would have scrunched it at the faint smell of dried herbs and sawdust. *Pitiful little store.* Aaron walked around the shelves, grabbing himself a lantern, 50 feet of rope, and a deer-hide waterskin. Items collected, Aaron considered just leaving the establishment without paying, whoever this "Drellen" was, he would deserve it for not worshipping Alaegor. Something decided better, deeper than thought, and Aaron strode up to the counter. He dropped the items down onto it, and then a little harder than supposed to, he rung the bell.

"Oh?! Helloo?" A surprised, exotic accented voice called out from a back room. From a door behind the counter, emerged a round-faced human with caramel skin. A pair of spectacles balanced precariously on the tip of his nose. Aaron noticed the man's hands were stained with ink.
"Good morning! And who's delivery are you ere for?" The man, Drellen, Aaron supposed, spoke in an accent Aaron had never heard before.
"I am no porter." Growled Aaron.
"Ohh, my apologies my medal friend." Drellen looked at his hands before wiping them on a stained apron that Aaron could was originally white. "Drellen Fairhollow." Drellen held out a hand for Aaron to shake; which Aaron did not accept. Drellen rescinded his hand.
"Whad would you like purchase from my sdore?" Aaron noticed Drellen's "t"'s sounded more like "d"'s, and he seemed to roll his "r"'s.
"Just these." Aaron gestured to the items on the counter. "And be quick."
"Ok, ok, right away." Aaron watched as Drellen recorded the products and their sale on a clipboard.
"Ok, five gold and eight silver." 
"Here." Aaron tumbled the few pieces out of a coin pouch. Drellen eyed the coins with a look of increased intrigue. Aaron knew not why he found the coins so interesting, nor did he care. He scraped the items into his pack, and left the store. Aaron judged by the progress of the sun that he still had some time before he had to meet up with the others. With this extra time, he chose to explore a little more of the Trade District. As he wandered, his eyes followed whatever they fancied; a boutique tailor's, a blacksmith's, a potion house, and a magic shop. More importantly, he noticed that seemingly no matter where he walked, the magic shop was always at the edge of his vision. Aaron found this perplexing, and he was not one to be perplexed. He approached the shop, **Angela Shop Description**. With a yank, he slammed open the door and stepped over the threshold, and was immediately punched in the face by the various strong scents of the shop. Most were floral in nature, others were metallic, but they were all overwhelmingly the stink of heretic magic. **Angela Shop Description**, and at the far end there was a counter. Behind the counter was a wall of drawers, split in the middle by a walkway through which multiple more such drawer-walls could be seen. The walkway ended with a door. Atop the counter sat a bell for service. Aaron made his way to the counter, and reached out a hand to ring the bell when he heard a yowl. He snapped his head up towards the source of the sound, tracking it to a midnight-black cat that sat perched inside an open drawer in the row second from the top of the left set. The cat stared deeply into Aaron's eyes, before slowly, intelligently, blinking its own.
"What can I do for yah?" Aaron's gaze snapped down towards the words, to find a hunched old lady now standing behind the counter. She looked Human, and to be only a handful of years from the end of her life. She had puzzlingly orange, curly and frizzled hair which reached a little past her shoulders.

"Sorry?" Aaron stammered.
"If yah don't know what yer here to buy, then why or yah here?" Spoke the woman with an almost annoyed assertiveness. Her accent had a gutturality to it, with some rolled consonants and mismatched vowels. Almost more something you would hear from the depths of a Dwarf's beard than a Caeloran.
"I-." Aaron backstepped. It was rare the occasion Aaron was on the backfoot in a conversation, and he was thrown. Annoyed at the situation he found himself in, Aaron resolved to leave the magic shop and head straight to the stables.
"It was nice seeing yoo, Aaron." With a gruff huff, Aaron exited the magic shop. Only once he had left the shop and walked half the distance to the stables had he realised the woman had known his name, despite Aaron never having told her. All of the Caelora City stables were **Something** establishments, having been some of the city's first real infrastructure. As such, they had an aged air to them, yet were kept in tip-top condition. Seeing as they are the first travellers would see of the grand city, the City wanted to make the best first impression. Upon entering the grand north-western stables, Aaron found his co-employees dotted around and in a simple cart. The cart was a cross between a passenger carriage, and cargo trailer, with side and front walls hip-height from the base. Four wooden posts rose up from each corner, from which struts branched out to connect between, and tied to the tops of each post was a pseudo roof
made of an almost canvas material. A **Word that means place where carriagedriver sits** sat overhanging from where the front half-wall and base connected, supported by two triangular struts of its own. Natalie hung from one of the struts connecting the posts, inspecting the sheet roof. Gabriel and Lyric stood to the side, discussing the logistics of supplies, and journey length. Wiate and Michael sat inside the cart, one more lazily than the other despite the heavy armour they bore.
"Ah, Aaron you're here. Uh- alright, I think it's time for us to head out." Lyric declared when he spotted Aaron. Aaron responded only with a gruff of acknowledgement, before swinging his pack into the cart. Wiate took up the reigns
