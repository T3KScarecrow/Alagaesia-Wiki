#### From _"Constructs and Curiosities: Artifice of the Ancients"_ by Jorath Fizzlesprocket

Of all the constructs whispered about in dusty tomes, none are as enigmatic—or as tragic—as the **Heartwrought Golem**. A creation of the Forebearers themselves, these sentient automatons were crafted not from stone or metal but from living crystal, pulsing with the rhythm of an artificial heart.

Legends differ on the purpose of these beings. Some say they were protectors, designed to guard sacred sites and ancient treasures. Others believe they were companions, imbued with emotions to serve as eternal friends or lovers to their creators. Whatever their purpose, one truth remains: the Heartwrought Golems are incomplete.

Their crystalline hearts, though beautiful, are unstable. Over centuries, the magic sustaining them begins to fail, and they are overcome by despair. Driven by the memory of their creators—long gone—they wander ruins and forgotten places, searching for something to fill the void left by their fading hearts.

It is said that if one encounters a Heartwrought Golem, it may seek to bond with the intruder, mistaking them for its lost creator. Those who accept this bond gain a loyal companion, but at a cost: the Golem’s heart will slowly drain their life essence, unknowingly dooming them both. To refuse, however, is to risk incurring its wrath, for a broken heart can turn even the gentlest of beings into a monster.
