Alden used to be an artificer that specialised in making the warforged for the Mechinators, but as he grew older, he realised that his Myasthenia Gravis was growing worse. Realising that he wouldn't be able to be an artificer anymore, he decided to put that part of his life behind him and went off to live a quiet and peaceful life on his own farm. He quickly learned that running a farm alone was no easy task, especially in his condition, so, using his experience, Alden made three warforged; AS-7924 (Asher), AN-6347 (Andrew) and AR-8125 (Aaron), to be farmhands. However, even with the help, he still grew weaker by the day.

After some months working the farm with his pseudo-children, Alden decided to use what time he had left to try and give self awareness to the three that had helped him in the time he spent with the farm. He first tried the process on Asher. However, upon Asher's awakening, he immediately lashed out and went insane, blowing himself up. Alden realised that the reason was that Asher had kept all his previous memories, and because of this, it Alden experience an overzealous flood of memories hitting him at once. This proved too much for the warforged's mind, causing him to go mad. After the loss of his first "son", Alden made sure that the other two only remembered that they were related to each other. He only impressed upon them that in some way the two remaining warforged were like siblings. With that, Alden had started working on awakening Aaron and Andrew.

Sometime later, Aaron had awoken, and upon leaving the workshop that was used for maintaining the three warforged, he saw that the farm had been half destroyed. While Aaron had been waking, a raid party had rolled through, stealing anything they could and killing anyone in their way, but luckily they didn't find the workshop. After investigating the now destroyed farm, Aaron found the lifeless body of Alden clutching a stack of papers on a desk next to him. Inscribed on the papers was a log of everything about the three warforged, explaining how; Alden made them, his plan to make them self aware, how the first went mad, and some entries about Andrew. They explained how Andrew had woken up early, just before the raid, and said that he wished to explore the world now that hes free, and to tell Aaron to come looking for him when he wakes up. Aaron sees a map in between all the notes and takes it, intending to do what his "brother" had asked him to, no matter what
