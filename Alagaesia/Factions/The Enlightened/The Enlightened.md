The **Enlightened** is a fervent religious faction that emerged from the ashes of the [[The Fall of the Forebearers|Fall of the Forebearers]]. Initially founded by a group of passionate humans, this organization has evolved dramatically over the centuries. Through a combination of fervent zeal, intricate rituals, and the intertwining of divine magic, the Enlightened has grown to encompass not only [[The Humans|humans but also archangels, nephilims, and rare instances of Warforged—metallic or stone constructs imbued with sentience.

As a zealous faction, the Enlightened has dedicated itself to expanding its influence, having successfully annexed new territories three times in the last century alone. These expansions have come at the cost of nearby farms and villages, where the Enlightened has ransacked or invaded in the name of their One True God, forcibly assimilating or exterminating those who resist. Their crusades are marked by fervour and brutality, driven by an unwavering belief in their divine mandate.

### **Beliefs and Doctrine**

The core belief of the Enlightened is that magic is a divine gift bestowed upon the worthy by the One True God. They view any use of magic outside their teachings as a perversion of this sacred gift. Consequently, they believe that individuals—especially nonbelievers, spellcasters, and those of non-human races—must either be converted or eradicated to restore what they perceive as divine order. This ideology has fostered an intense animosity toward dwarves, centaurs, elves, and other magic-adept races, whom they consider heretics and threats to their divine mission.

### **Lore**

The Enlightened's origins are deeply intertwined with the catastrophic events surrounding the Fall of the Forebearers. The initial members witnessed firsthand the wrath of the One True God as entire civilizations crumbled, reinforcing their belief that divine punishment befalls those who stray from the righteous path. This experience galvanized their resolve to spread their faith, viewing their mission as a holy crusade against blasphemy and heresy.

### **Leadership**

The Enlightened is led by **[[Lord Tyrannus]]**, a figure both revered and feared. Known for his charismatic speeches and ruthless tactics, Tyrannus embodies the faction's zealous spirit. Under his leadership, the Enlightened has become more organized and militarized, with his commands often translating into swift and brutal actions against those deemed unworthy. His vision for a world unified under the One True God drives the faction’s relentless expansion, making him a pivotal force in the ongoing conflict with other races and factions. The faction is split into two divisions, each operating from different cities, with slightly differing governing structures.

#### Divisions of The Enlightened

##### 1. **The Holy Order of the Vanguard**

**Description**: The Holy Order of the Vanguard serves as the militant and crusading arm of The Enlightened. Its mission is to expand Alaegor's influence through conquest and forceful assimilation. The Vanguard is known for their rigorous discipline, zealous faith, and unyielding approach to warfare. Members of this order see themselves as the true bearers of Alaegor’s will, dedicated to spreading his doctrine and purging those they deem heretical. Clad in ornate armour inscribed with holy symbols, they march under banners of pure white emblazoned with a golden flame, symbolizing divine purification.

##### 2. **The Inquisitorial Sanctum**

Members of the Sanctum, known as Inquisitors, are tasked with rooting out dissent, heresy, and any threats to Alaegor's will from within The Enlightened's territories and beyond. Their methods often involve psychological manipulation, magic-infused interrogation, and covert operations. The Sanctum's symbol is a golden eye set against a black background, symbolizing unblinking vigilance.
