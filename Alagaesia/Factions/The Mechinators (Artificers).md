The Mechinators are a faction who believe in the manipulation of magic to power and control automatons and other devices in order to create an optimised, automated society. 

### Lore:
Thousands of years after the fall of the Forebearers, a small band of Vulgomage took up residence in some ruins of their city Hargraven. There, they studied the scrolls and teachings left behind, until they too were able to harness the magic of artificery. Driven by fatal curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and power, the Mechinators arose from the ashes of the Forebearers with the sole objective of creating the perfect system of society.

### Leadership:
The Mechinators follow a dictatorship structure, and are lead by a man who is more machine than their original race named CLU. CLU rarely shows his face in public, preferring to stay locked away in his laboratory. His lackies, Dyson and Tesler take care of CLU's federation.
