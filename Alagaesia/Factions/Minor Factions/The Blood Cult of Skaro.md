The **Blood Cult of Skaro** is a sinister and secretive faction shrouded in dread. This cult, known for its fanatical devotion to dark and forbidden knowledge, operates in the shadows, evoking fear among even the bravest denizens of Caelora and beyond. Their reach extends into the hidden corners of civilization, where they practice their rites and commit atrocities in service to their revered object, the **Necronomicon**.

### Structure and Hierarchy:
- **The Grand Hierophant**: The leader of the Blood Cult of Skaro, often a powerful spellcaster such as a lich or a vampire. They are the guardian of the Necronomicon and dictate the cult's goals and rituals. The current Grand Hierophant is a mysterious figure named **Malachar the Sanguine**, whose origins are obscured by layers of deceit and myth.
- **The Crimson Circle**: A council of high-ranking cultists, usually warlocks (pact of the Great Old One), blood clerics, or necromancers, who manage regional cult operations. Each member bears the title **Blood Cardinal** and possesses a unique artifact of power linked to the Necronomicon's dark magic.
- **Bloodhands**: Enforcers and ritual leaders who organize sacrifices, enforce loyalty, and conduct blood magic rituals. They are proficient in combat and possess abilities akin to Eldritch Knights or blood hunters.
- **Initiates**: The newest members of the cult, often drawn from the disillusioned, desperate, or power-hungry. They must undergo gruesome trials to prove their worth, often involving self-inflicted bloodletting and spells such as *inflict wounds* or *blood spear*.

### Important Members:
- **Malachar the Sanguine**: The enigmatic Grand Hierophant, wielding powerful necromantic magic. Rumours suggest that Malachar is centuries old, sustained by ancient blood rites.
- **Cardinal Elaria Darkwell**: A cunning and charismatic Blood Cardinal who is known for infiltrating influential positions in society under assumed identities.
- **Norrick Bleakfist**: A formidable Bloodhand, a former knight turned cultist whose armour is infused with runes that enhance blood magic. He acts as the cult's primary war commander.

### History:
The cult's origins trace back to a forgotten age, whispered to have begun when a cursed scholar discovered the **Necronomicon** in the ruins of a Forebearer city. This tome, said to hold the secrets of death, resurrection, and blood manipulation, drove the cult to practice unspeakable rites to unlock its power. Throughout history, the Blood Cult of Skaro has committed atrocities to spread their influence, sowing terror in the pursuit of their ultimate goal: awakening an ancient being from the void hinted at in the Necronomicon.

### Acts of Worship and Violence:
- **Blood Sacraments**: The cult's primary ritual involves the draining of blood from willing or unwilling participants to empower dark spells, often using *ceremony* and *summon greater demon* as part of their rites.
- **The Scarlet Conclave**: An annual event where cultists from across the land gather to perform a mass sacrifice under the moons Aegirion and Aelora, believed to heighten the book’s potency.
- **Terror Raids**: The Bloodhands lead raids on villages and temples to capture sacrifices and artifacts. These attacks leave behind scenes of carnage, where blood sigils etched into walls mark their passage.
- **The Ritual of Living Rebirth**: A horrifying rite where a cultist channels power from the Necronomicon to resurrect a fallen comrade, binding their life force through blood. This act creates revenant-like thralls under the cult’s control.

The Blood Cult of Skaro remains a deadly threat, casting a long shadow over the lands with their relentless pursuit of blood and forbidden power.




#### Necronomicon

Original inspiration for the cult was a disgraced Forebearer sect. They found or made or were given the Necronomicon. The other Forebearers disgraced them and unbound the Necronomicon, scattering its pages across the lands. Separate, the pages have power but not ultimate; they need to be rebound. The Blood Cult has some pages, and some people of it have soul crystals to store their allotted amount for the rebinding ritual. Some bounty hunters have these for their more demonic clientele.
