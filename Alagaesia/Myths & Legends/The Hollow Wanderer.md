#### From _"Terrors and Spooks That Might Be True"_ by Beatrisa Wynstone

Have you ever felt the prickling sensation of being watched, only to turn and see no one there? That, dear reader, may be the presence of the Hollow Wanderer. This figure, a gaunt silhouette with a face of ever-shifting shadows, is said to follow those who have meddled with the forbiddenâ€”ancient artifacts, cursed tomes, or abandoned temples best left forgotten.

The Wanderer does not speak, nor does it attack. Instead, it lingers at the edge of sight, just out of reach. This gives me the heebus jeebus. Everything attacks, so why doesn't it? Some say it feeds on fear, growing stronger the more its victim succumbs to paranoia. Others claim it is a warning, a manifestation of the gods' disapproval, meant to guide the trespasser back to the path of wisdom.

One chilling tale recounts a scholar who unearthed a Forebearer artifact from the ruins of their cities. I don't really subscribe to the mysteries of the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]], as you can never discern the fact from the fiction. The artifact, a small, unassuming pendant, radiated an otherworldly hum. That night, the scholar began seeing the Wanderer, first in fleeting glimpses, then standing in the corners of their study. Desperate to escape its gaze, the scholar fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again. This is why I never mess with [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] ruins.

Whether the Hollow Wanderer is a spirit, a punishment, or a figment of the mind, its presence is enough to unnerve even the most hardened adventurer.
