### Chapter 1: The Silver Quill

A man, not quite Elven nor wholly Human, wearing **ROBES** and a **PENDANT** stood in the cobblestone street checking a piece of parchment. 

*Gabriel **SOMETHING** of **SOMETHING CHURCHY**                  13th Marcion 1342
I hope this letter finds you well.
After an intense combing through of candidates, the Grand Museum Of Arcane History
is glad to welcome you into its newest initiative. For your convenience, you shall find accommodation at the Silver Quill tavern, paid for by the MOAH. Please arrive at the MOAH 
on the 14th at midday to meet your partymates and for more instructions.*

*Professionally,
Lasscial Vaelithar*

Gabriel pocketed the small letter and looked around the street. He had only been in Caelora City for a short while now, and had rarely explored the Guild District. It had taken him twenty minutes to find the Silver Quill, and reasoned that the Museum would choose the closest tavern to serve the members of its "newest initiative". Gabriel did not know much about the job he had signed up for, but what he did know was thus; he would be joining a contracted group of adventurers, and would be travelling across much of Caldoran. Gabriel did not care much himself for adventuring or those who partake in it. He had signed up in pursuit of the knowledge he might uncover. After another twenty or so minutes of wandering, Gabriel saw them; the grandiose marble pillars, the ancient-inspired architecture, a group of curiously dressed individuals standing out the front, each unique from the others. Gabriel approached the group, assessing them as he neared: A menacing Automaton who seemed grand in posture and presence yet was only average in height. The almost-midday sun glinted magically off its intricate dark steel armour-skin. Gabriel couldn't make out a symbol indented in its shoulder. A fit and slender Human woman, a warrior or soldier no doubt with straight shoulder-length, dirt coloured hair, a weary expression in her eyes. A large, stocky and muscular Human man who wore a holy pendant of his own; 
*Nahzu*. Gabriel made a mental note. And finally, a similarly tall Human man, although a stark contrast to the prior with his wiry and intelligent demeanour. 

"Greetings. I assume you all are here for the MOAH job?" queried Gabriel.
The group tilted their heads slightly at his accent. The woman was the one to answer.
"Yes. I am Natalie Porter"
"Gabriel." The two shook hands.
"Ah, another holy man, I see!" The muscular man took Gabriel's hand into a firm shake. "Michael's the name."
"A pleasure." replied Gabriel after he extricated his hand from the too-long greeting.
"Hello. I am Wiate." The more scholarly man proffered. Another handshake ensued.
Gabriel looked at the Automaton. When it did not acknowledge him, he asked "Does it have a name?"
"Yes, I in fact do, heretic." Its voice was barely artificial sounding and low in pitch but not in volume, the last word spat out.
"My apologies. I meant no offence..." Gabriel waited for a name which did not come.
"Aaron. It said its name was Aaron. When Michael arrived, Mr Metal stopped talking." Natalie explained.
"Yeah. I never knew a hunk of metal to have such an attitude." Michael laughed heartily.
"You bite your tongue, Moonprayer, or I'll smash your head against the cobblestone!" Aaron spoke with much venom. After a few minutes in an awkward silence, the tension too high to speak, a small yet proper voice announced behind them. 
"Good day, adventurers! I - um, I am Lyric Alderwyn. I shall be your liaison to the MOAH and guide." Upon tracing the voice back to its origin, the group were presented with a small, very well dressed, scholarly Elf. He seemed to be young for an Elf. Everything about his appearance screamed he was not one for adventure; his neatly combed chestnut hair, his circular copper-rimmed glasses, his lithe form, and his high-collared, cream-coloured tunic, and tailored vest. *At least I'll have someone to talk to*, Gabriel thought to himself.

Lyric guided the group to the Silver Quill, where inside he explained the party's role and first mission. The party took in the tavern as Lyric spoke. The main word that came to mind was "cheap". The Silver Quill definitely did not put the MOAH out of pocket. It served as a place for scholars and historians and cartographers of the nearby Museum to get a drink, usually of tea or a special warm brew which invigorated its drinker, and study books or maps or even ancient artefacts. It was not a place for warriors, or thieves...*or us*. Gabriel looked to his partymates. If they felt out of place, they did not show it. In fact, they did not seem to care whatsoever. Natalie, a soldier, was probably used to worse. Michael, a man of seemingly few thoughts, would not have the faculties to care. Aaron was an artificial servant. But Wiate, Gabriel could not figure out. He was different, yet Gabriel did not know how. At a booth, Lyric went on to describe the mission.
"Long ago, there was this civilisation, brothers and sisters to the Elves, called the Forebearers. Well, that's what we call them, nobody remembers what they called themselves. Anyway, they were a race of artificers and magical, mechanical artisans. They learnt the secrets of magic and the world, and used them to create wonders the like you have never seen. That is, until they Fell. No one knows what actually happened, or if any do, they are sworn to secrecy. This is the MOAH's mission. They seek to excavate the forgotten history of this ancient people, but they can't do it alone. You see, the MOAH is all historians and academics, like me. We can't go trouncing across the wilderness, into the Wilds, chasing unfounded rumours. That would be a waste of precious research time, let alone dangerous. This is where you five come in."

Under his breath and quite enough for no one to hear, Lyric sibilated,
"Five? I could have sworn to the Gods there was supposed to be six." Lyric quietly recounted.
Natalie, Wiate, and Gabriel all sat in thinking silence, processing this information.
"So we are hired swords to be sent out into the forest and across the lands in search of ancient loot?" Michael demanded, almost angrily.
"Fantastic! I love me a good treasure and the chance to protect travellers." Laughed Michael before anyone else could answer his apparent rhetoric. Gabriel caught the religious allusion Michael had made, it being a reference to the oath worshippers of the Moon God of Justice, Nahzu swear. Gabriel did not know much of the other religions of the world, focussing his studies mainly on his, his being the Goddess of Healing and Compassion, Vitalas. Despite this, when he had first arrived in Caelora City, he had made it a goal to learn more on as many topics as were discussed in the church's library. Thanks to his slightly closed-off upbringing, Gabriel was surprised to find there were as many Gods as he did.
"What specifically would we be doing? Investigating?" Natalie asked, leaning forward to get more of an answer out of the timid Lyric.
"Um - Well, all across the lands, there are rumours, whispers, tales told to children to stop them from playing in the woods, and so on. Some of these are well-founded. Especially in the unaligned Wilds, there are ruins, monuments, dungeons, underground temples, many of which from the time of the Forebearers. These such sites, the MOAH seeks to map and catalogue, but we can't do that if we don't know where they are, if the rumours are true. You will be going to the approximated areas where such rumoured locations lie, and then explore anything you find there, bringing with you any artefacts and information when you report back."

Natalie leaned back in her seat, slouching slightly, crossing her arms. She seemed to mull it over. Finally, Wiate spoke.
"The Wilds, you say? Will we go anyplace near Ironhenge?"
"I can't say for certain, but it's possible." The Automaton got up from its seat.
"I need a drink." Lyric began to respond, but Aaron walked away to the bar, not listening.
"The MOAH has paid for a few beverages and meals before your first mission." Wiate eyed Aaron as it walked away, seemingly fascinated by the design and artistry of the marvellous machinations powering it.
"And what is our first mission?" Gabriel queried.
"Yes, quite right. Okay. Some sources tell of a stone spiral staircase in the middle of nowhere. Of those who venture down the steps, many leave as corpses whose cause of death seem to be bolts of lightning. The majority who leave alive describe a dark room with a large stone door. Nothing seems to be able to open the door, no key, no amount of force. There are also murals of some kind on the walls. I hypothesise it to be some kind of Forebearer dungeon, and the source of the lightning a magical trap."
"You hypothesise?" Natalie questions, raising an eyebrow.
"Well, yes. Yous are the ones being sent to find out."

Aaron returned to the booth, this time with a large bottle of expensive wine. It not so much popped the cork off as pulled it off with its metal hand, and took a large swig.
"Much better."
"You can drink?" Gabriel asked.
"Yes. I don't need to though, if that was your next question. I drink when I want, and I want often. It makes my....me tingle." Aaron explained, a hint a snideness to his words. Previously hidden from the brightness of the direct midday sun, Gabriel could now see lines of blue magical energy flow between the "plates" of Aaron's armour-skin, serving to split the sections up. The energy seemed to eb and flow, and after much focus, Gabriel could make out a pseudo heartbeat in the brightness of the magic. The magic sparkled slightly whenever Aaron took a swig.
"Ha! ' makes me tingle too!" Michael clapped a large hand on Aaron's back, and tried to take a swig of his own, though the bottle was pulled out of his reach.
"You're not like any Automaton I've ever seen." Gabriel mused.
"You're like every Elf I've seen." Gabriel brushed off the snide remark. Insults were not Vitalas' way.

The conversation lead into evening, and the party grew hungry. Aaron was the first to act on this sensation, abruptly standing and heading to the bar. Michael followed, eager for a nice warm roast and a mead to wash it down. He would definitely make sure to fill up before they set off.
"Would you like anything?" Natalie asked those who remained seated.
Gabriel squinted to make out the various meals displayed on the large blackboard above the bar. "I'll take a a roast pork and salad, with a murky tea. Thanks."
"Got it."
"Um, - I'll take a chicken sandwich, and just water, thanks." Lyric requested. It seemed that Lyric had come here with a script, a certain amount of exposition he must have practiced reciting, and once he had run out of pre-planned responses, he was noticeably more meek.
"I'll have what Gabriel's having." Said Wiate.
"Okay, I'm going to go make sure those two buffoons don't make trouble." Natalie sigh-growled as she walked away. Natalie approached the bar to unsurprisingly already find trouble.
"For the love of Alaegor, just give me some Stormbringer!" Aaron smashed its fist down on the old, mead-varnished bar.
"Whoa, a violent drunk, eh? Shh, shh, shhhh, that's ok, take a seat, drink up." The middle-aged Human bartender ushered Aaron into a stool, and slid a glass of water into its hand. Natalie regarded the man closely, ever watchful for potential threats in case conflict arose. He had a shock of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a pair of green twinkling eyes. His lean physique and scarred hands hinted to a more outdoor previous occupation. Soldier or farmer, perhaps?
