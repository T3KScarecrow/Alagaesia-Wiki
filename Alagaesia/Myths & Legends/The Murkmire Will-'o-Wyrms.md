> Swamps are bad enough without glowing worms leading you to your doom, wouldn’t you agree? Every child in the Murkmire knows to steer clear of **Will-o’-Wyrms**, those eerie little lights that hover over the bogs at twilight. They’re small things, no bigger than a cat, with wriggling, serpentine bodies and soft, ethereal glows in shades of sickly green and ghostly blue.

But don’t be fooled by their innocent appearance—these creatures aren’t here to guide you. Quite the opposite. The Will-o’-Wyrms feed on fear and desperation. They appear only to the lost, luring them deeper into the swamp with their flickering light. Some say the Wyrms are the restless spirits of drowned travellers, while others believe they are nature’s way of punishing the careless.

Legends tell of brave souls who’ve tried to catch or destroy the Wyrms. None have succeeded, of course. If you try to grab one, it simply vanishes, only to reappear just out of reach. Weapons pass right through them. And if you follow them too far, well… let’s just say you won’t be following anything again.
