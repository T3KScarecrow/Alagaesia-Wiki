Nythrien was a famed, and believed crazy, inventor from the days of the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]]. They are only known now by historians due to the amount of abnormal schematics and broken devices of their creation that have been unearthed, and the countless references to them in texts made by fellow [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] inventors as "unnatural" and "obsessed". When Nythrien died, they left one final nameless invention, only partially finished: what their fellow [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] and now modern historians call _[[The Relic of Nythrien]]_. Ever the secretive and enigmatic one, Nythrien left no blueprints to The Relic, nor any coherent description of its contents nor use.
