Upon landing, we were met by an elf named Calraen Adderman, one of two adventurers who had arrived in [[Falshire]] before us and had been investigating the disappearances. He wasted no time in ushering us to the Blackthorn Inn, where he explained what he knew of the situation.

The town is in a state of distress. Its people drink as much Scholar’s Brew as they can get their hands on, desperate to stave off sleep. This is no simple case of missing persons—there is something unnatural at work here, something that gnaws at the minds of the townsfolk and hunts them when they are most vulnerable.

Varcius, the second adventurer, arrived partway through our discussion, returning from a mission to find a missing girl. He seemed exhausted, and for good reason. He later retired for a much-needed rest.

After learning what we could at the inn, Calraen led most of us to Lord Taviel’s manor, as he was the town’s governing figure. Aaron, as expected, stayed behind for reasons I did not inquire about. Upon arrival, we split into two groups: Natalie and I took one path while Calraen, Gabriel, and Varcius took another.

Inside, we found a library. Scattered on a desk were frantic drawings of symbols, words scrawled in a desperate hand. One page read: "Whatever you do, you mustn’t listen. Lies, lies, lies. Don’t listen. Listen, and they have you."

Natalie pocketed it.

Among the papers was an open book. A familiar one. The very same _[[Terrors And Spooks That Might Just Be True Index|Terrors & Spooks That Might Just Be True]]_ that I own, opened to the entry on creatures called "[[The Whisperers]]".

This is no coincidence.
I will have to read up on that entry in my own copy, when I get the chance.

Meanwhile, just as Calraen and the others were about to enter the manor’s basement, Gabriel and Varcius sensed a fiendish presence back in town. They ran, and Gabriel managed to send me a psychic message explaining what had happened.

The weight in my chest has only grown heavier.

Something is terribly wrong here.

And I fear it has only just begun.
