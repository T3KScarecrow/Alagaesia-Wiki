Kaluman, the luminous undersea city of the Triton race, lies nestled in the depths of the Cerulean Abyss, a vast chasm surrounded by shimmering coral forests and bioluminescent caverns. The city’s architecture is an elegant blend of organic and crystalline structures, with sweeping towers of pearl-encrusted stone and glowing, blue-veined domes. These structures pulse faintly, casting an ethereal light that mimics the glow of the deep ocean. Veils of translucent kelp sway gently in the currents, and schools of radiant fish dart through the city, illuminating it further with their glistening scales.

### History
Kaluman was founded centuries ago by the legendary Triton explorer, Meralon Tidebreaker, who led his kin to this safe haven after the ancient Battle of the Thalassic Rift, where they fought against monstrous sea leviathans. The city grew under the leadership of successive noble houses, who fostered a balance between exploration and diplomacy with the surface world. Kaluman’s strategic location made it a focal point for both trade and defense, shaping its role as a bastion of Triton culture and military strength.

The city has weathered multiple incursions from abyssal horrors and the occasional territorial skirmish with rogue merfolk clans. Yet, through each challenge, Kaluman emerged resilient, bolstered by its alliance with the wise Elders of the Coral Council and the unwavering guardianship of its Triton warriors.

### Governing System
Kaluman is ruled by the Coral Council, a body of twelve elder Tritons, each representing a different facet of their society—war, diplomacy, trade, and knowledge among them. Decisions are made collectively, with High Counselor Nerith Stormsong acting as the head of the council. Known for her shrewd political mind and mastery of both song-magic and battle strategy, Nerith has guided Kaluman through both prosperous and tumultuous times.

### Important Places

- **Hall of Whispering Currents**: A mystical library where water-bound scrolls and ancient stone tablets are kept. This hall is attended by deep-sea sages who read the currents for messages from the past and potential omens of the future.
- **Fortress Marea**: Kaluman’s formidable defense outpost, located at the mouth of the Cerulean Abyss. Manned by elite Triton guards, its walls are imbued with luminescent runes that can repel or disorient hostile creatures.
- **The Shimmering Plaza**: The commercial heart of Kaluman, bustling with traders offering rare pearls, enchanted kelp, and exotic sea minerals. It is a place where surface dwellers occasionally visit to engage in trade under strict supervision.

### Notable Figures
- **High Counselor Nerith Stormsong**: A seasoned leader and master of both politics and the Tritons’ arcane singing.

Kaluman’s breathtaking architecture, rich history, and strategic importance make it a cornerstone of The Undersea, reflecting the harmony and resilience of its Triton inhabitants.
