Originally known by the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] as Noctyrex, Nyrex is the [[The Vulgomage|Vulgomage]] god of shadows, stealth and the unknown. A deity of subtlety and precision, Nyrex is revered by scouts, spies, and night wanderers. They appear as a figure cloaked in shifting shadows, with glowing silver eyes. A form of their prayer is frequently used by members of the Thieves Guild when greeting possible contacts as a way to determine if they are speaking with a fellow member.
