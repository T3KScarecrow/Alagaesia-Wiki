Caelora, the resplendent capital of [[The Vulgomage]] kingdom of the same name, is an intricate fusion of human ambition, magic, and culture. Rising from the fertile plains, its skyline glitters with spellbound towers and domed structures adorned in silvered metal and polished stone. The city’s many districts pulse with energy: bustling markets, vibrant theaters, scholarly enclaves, and artisan quarters create a colorful, cacophonous cityscape. Caelora’s architectural style celebrates the ingenuity of humans while incorporating natural elements, with ivy-covered towers and living stone walls that glow with arcane enchantments.

The **Algorna River** flows alongside the city, supplying fresh water and serving as a central trade route for merchant ships bearing exotic goods. Along the riverfront, Caelora’s **Sunken Gardens** are a famed meeting place, with terraces that dip down to touch the water and feature floating platforms where magicians perform dazzling feats of elemental magic.

### Important Locations

#### The Spire of the Magisterium
The tallest structure in Caelora, known as the **Spire of the Magisterium**, houses the council chambers of the Magisterium, the governing body of powerful mages who oversee Caelora and its territories. The Spire itself is a blend of polished marble and enchanted crystal, with observation decks from which citizens can observe shimmering illusions cast by the council as decrees are made public. Above, a magical beacon shines each evening, lighting the sky in Caelora’s official colors as a reminder of the kingdom's vigilance and might.

#### The Great Museum of Arcane History
A cornerstone of Caelora's cultural landscape, the **Great Museum of Arcane History (MoAH)** stands with beautifully ornate marble pillars and grand architecture inspired by ancient eras. This museum, operated by the Archaeologers Guild, is more than a simple collection; it is an interactive journey through magic and time. Visitors can explore the **Hall of Enigmas**, a room where puzzles and illusions immerse guests in magical riddles, or **The Vault of the Ancients**, where only the most powerful artifacts of bygone eras are displayed behind layers of protective enchantments.
