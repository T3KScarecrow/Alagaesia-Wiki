#### From _"Arcane Oddities and Their Unlikely Origins"_ by Professor Velmina Graddock

The _Whispering Hourglass_ is an artifact as chilling as it is fascinating. Encased in a frame of dark steel, the sand within the hourglass is said to shimmer like ground diamonds and move contrary to the laws of gravity, often flowing upward when flipped.

The true oddity lies in the whispers that emanate from the artifact when it is activated. Those who listen claim to hear fragmented conversations from moments long pastâ€”or even glimpses of possible futures. I myself can recount a tale of an elven diviner who became obsessed with the hourglass, convinced it revealed truths the gods wished hidden. Tragically, the diviner's mind unraveled, leaving behind incoherent notes scrawled with phrases like "the sands flow where the dead cannot" and "each grain, a thread of fate."
