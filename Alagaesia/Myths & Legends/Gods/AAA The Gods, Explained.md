In this world, the gods are real, and they can and sometimes do show themselves and interact with the mortal plane. As the gods are real, many people in this world are religious, and gods aren't "created" or the like by a group of people deciding to believe in a new god. There are quantifiable number of gods, with varying power and devotion. Centuries ago, before the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] became the technological race they are now known as, they too worshipped gods. As they are the sister race to the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]], the Elves too worshipped gods, and many still do to this day. AfterAt some point, the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] moved away from faith and towards science, leaving their gods behind, but before this the first humans sailed to Alagaesia. The humans brought the word of some gods with them from their homeland, but largely the gods they worship today are not their own. Before the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] left religion behind, they were happy to enlighten the new race in the ways of their gods.
