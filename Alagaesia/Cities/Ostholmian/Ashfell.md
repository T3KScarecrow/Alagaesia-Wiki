Ashfell clings to the **lower southeastern cliffs of Ostholme**, nestled at the base of **Mount Varram**, a dormant (though occasionally grumbling) volcano. The city is half-built into volcanic rock, its walls dark and streaked with iron and obsidian. Ashfell is prone to mild tremors and sulphur-scented winds, and at night the clouds glow faintly red from the deep thermal activity beneath the city.

Its proximity to the coast gives it a strange beauty: **blackened stone on one side, ocean spray on the other**. Trade ships dock at ironclad piers, bringing foreign goods and even stranger ideas. The city has a reputation as a **haven for thinkers too unorthodox** for Caelora and too irreverent for Thalassara. It’s grimy, wealthy, curious—and **dangerously free**.

## **Brief History:**

Originally built by dwarves as a **mining outpost**, Ashfell was abandoned after a series of tremors collapsed several deep mines. Human settlers later rediscovered it and, fascinated by the ore-rich terrain and geothermal power, re-established the city. Over centuries, Ashfell became a **magnet for exiles, immigrants, and foreign scholars**, due in part to its tolerances and lucrative mineral trade.

The ruling merchant-nobility of Ostholme cares little for Ashfell's oddities—as long as it pays its taxes. Thus, the city’s **shadowy factions**, **obscure cults**, and **independent scholars** flourish behind closed doors and smoke-coloured windows.

## **The Order of the PeePeePooPoo 

A **scholarly society** headquartered in a repurposed dwarven watchtower overlooking Mount Varram’s crater, the **Ember Eye** is a small but well-respected cabal of researchers, lorekeepers, and magical naturalists. Their stated mission:

> “To observe the divine echoes left upon the mortal world—through stone, flame, and forgotten name.”

In public, they study how **minor deities** interact with natural phenomena—like volcano spirits, river gods, forgotten hearth deities, and storm patrons. They believe such powers **still linger in the land**, even if their worshippers are gone. They collect regional myths, conduct rituals of “invitation,” and keep a growing archive of **divine relic fragments** and **folk scriptures**.
