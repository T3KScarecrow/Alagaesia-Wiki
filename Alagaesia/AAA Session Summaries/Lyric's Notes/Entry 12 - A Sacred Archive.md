With [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] detained, [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] suggested we visit the Great Cathedral of Life. I had not expected what lay beneath its hallowed halls. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] led me to a hidden archive, concealed behind a secret door, where he revealed his true purpose for coming to [[Caelora]]: to find a cure for a magical sickness. The same sickness that claimed his mother and ravaged his hometown.

The texts here are [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] in origin but barely translated. They reference a holy relic of [[Vitalas]] herself, said to heal any wound or cure any ailment. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] believes it may be the key to his quest. Over the next few days, we delved into these texts, deciphering what we could. Progress was slow, but [[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel’s]] grasp of the [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] language grew with each attempt. His dedication is inspiring.
