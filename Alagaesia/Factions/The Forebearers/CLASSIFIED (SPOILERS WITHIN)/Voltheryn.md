Forbearer magic metal stone

## ✨ Properties

This isn’t just stone + metal — it’s a **fusion of matter and magic**, achievable only through Forebearer process. Key qualities:

1. **Durability & Resonance**
    
    - As strong as adamantine, but much lighter (like mithril).
        
    - Conducts magical energy _without_ degrading, acting like an arcane capacitor.
        
2. **Self-Harmonizing**
    
    - Tiny cracks or fractures slowly seal themselves (over days) if exposed to ambient mana.
        
    - Used for building “eternal” structures, hence why ruins still stand.
        
3. **Psychic Imprint**
    
    - Because it is forged with quicksilver (linked to minds/souls), it faintly _remembers intent_.
        
    - Tools made from it sometimes “respond” more efficiently to their wielder.
        
4. **Quicksilver Dependency**
    
    - Forebearer Quicksilver is the _catalyst_. Without it, attempts to replicate fail.
        
    - The quicksilver stabilizes the blend, bonding molten arcane metal with stone dust at a molecular level.

## 🛠️ Process (in lore)

- Base material: powdered ancient stone (special volcanic basalt-like mineral).
    
- Alloy base: sleek, silvery-blue metal harvested from deep veins (now largely exhausted).
    
- Catalyst: **Forebearer Quicksilver** — “living mercury” that binds thought, magic, and matter.
    
- Method: Heat beyond natural forge flames (arcane furnaces or runic crucibles). The quicksilver is dripped in at a critical phase, harmonizing stone + metal + magic.
    
- Result: The new alloy flows like molten glass before hardening into a sleek, obsidian-silver sheen.

## 🎲 Game Mechanic for Lendra

To make it _special but balanced_:

**Ability:** _Aetherforging_ (or whatever name you like)

- **Daily Limit:** Once per _long rest_, Lendra can create **1 unit of Forebearer Alloy**.
    
- **Unit Size:** About a fist-sized chunk (~1 lb). She can accumulate them over time.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Repairing Warforged/Machines**: Can replace missing parts or restore 1d8 HP per unit.
        
    - **Crafting**: When used as a material, reduces crafting time by half and creates superior quality.
        
    - **Spell Focus**: Can be consumed to empower a spell (reroll a failed spell attack or increase spell save DC by +1 for that spell).
        
- **Scaling:** At higher levels, she learns to produce more units per day or larger single pieces.
    

**Drawback (important for balance + drama):**

- Producing alloy requires her to **use a drop of Quicksilver** as catalyst. Once her vial runs dry, she must scavenge ruins or experiment to synthesize more (a whole quest hook!). 



# ⚒️ Lendra’s Alloy-Crafting Progression

_(using Forebearer Quicksilver + Transmutarcana runes)_

Each day, she can forge **1 unit** of alloy (scales with level/feat progression if you want). A “unit” is roughly enough for a weapon head, a small shield, or a critical gear/plate in a warforged body.

She’ll need:

- Access to a forge/heat source.
    
- Stone dust or powdered metal (cheap).
    
- A vial/drop of Quicksilver (scarce, so big story hook).
    
- Arcana check (DC depends on tier).

## Tier 1 — ✦ Foundation Crafting (Early Game)

Simple, practical applications. Mostly utility and light reinforcement.

- **Alloy Shards** – Tiny fragments that hum with magic; can replace costly material components worth up to 25 gp.
    
- **Reinforced Weapon Head** – Adds +1 to damage rolls (non-magical bonus). Can only be applied to simple weapons at this stage.
    
- **Plating Patch** – Repairs or temporarily bolsters a construct/warforged, restoring 1d8 HP.
    
- **Arcane Conduit Ring** – Tiny circular band; grants advantage on one spellcasting ability check before crumbling.


---

## Tier 2 — ✦ Runic Infusion (Mid Game)

She learns the **runic patterns** that stabilize enchantments within the alloy.

- **Resonant Core** – A small alloy disc that can hold 1st-level spell energy. Can be discharged later as a stored spell (like _Spell Storing Item_, but weaker).
    
- **Alloy armour Plating** – Grants +1 AC to light/medium armour pieces.
    
- **Construct Upgrade** – A warforged or golem with this reinforcement gains advantage on one Strength check/save per rest.
    
- **Alloy Tools** – Set of artisan’s tools that grant +2 to related checks and never break.
    

---

## Tier 3 — ✦ Structural Mastery (Later Mid Game)

She can now make **larger constructs and permanent enchantments.**

- **Living Weapon** – A weapon forged with alloy becomes **+1 magical** and hums faintly. Can house a rune (flame, frost, shock, etc.) for limited elemental damage.
    
- **Alloy Shielding** – Grants resistance to nonmagical slashing/piercing/bludgeoning for 1 minute (once per long rest).
    
- **Runic Focus Core** – Item acts as a spellcasting focus. Advantage on concentration saves while using it.
    
- **Automaton Repair Node** – Can revive a disabled warforged/construct if alloy is applied, restoring it to 1 HP instead of destruction.
    

---

## Tier 4 — ✦ Masterwork Transmutarcana (High Game)

This is “lost Forebearer magic” at its peak. Rare, story-defining.

- **Alloy Golem Heart** – A functioning power core for a construct. With enough units, she could build or repair **major Forebearer machines**.
    
- **Aetherbound Weapon** – Weapon forged becomes a **+2 magical weapon**, permanently attuned to its wielder. Can accept multiple rune infusions.
    
- **Self-Repairing armour** – armour slowly regenerates itself after damage. Once per day, can heal its wearer 2d10 HP.
    
- **Runed Keystone** – A block of alloy that can anchor a ward or barrier permanently, functioning like a semi-permanent magical structure.

## 🎲 Balancing Mechanics

- **Daily Limit**: 1 unit per long rest (scales to 2 units/day at higher levels).
    
- **Quicksilver**: Always required. Scarcity keeps it balanced — she’s motivated to hunt ruins, negotiate with factions, or experiment with substitutes.
    
- **Arcana Check**:
    
    - Tier 1: DC 12
        
    - Tier 2: DC 15
        
    - Tier 3: DC 18
        
    - Tier 4: DC 20+
        
- **Failure**: Alloy crumbles into inert slag (worthless).
    
- **Critical Success**: Product gains an _extra resonance_ (e.g. bonus damage die, stronger effect, or longer duration).


# ✦ Forebearer Rune Set

_(Each rune requires 1 alloy unit + 1 Quicksilver drop to forge. A successful Arcana check inscribes it; failure wastes the materials.)_

- **Rune of Dominion** – Rare. Weapon inscribed with this rune can force constructs to make a Wisdom save (DC = Lendra’s Arcana check) or obey one command.
    
- **Rune of Memory** – Stores knowledge. Can record up to 1 minute of sound/images, retrievable by touching the rune.

# 🎲 Mechanics in Play

- **Slots**: 1 rune per alloy piece (weapon head, armour plate, focus core, etc.).
    
- **Layering**: At higher tiers, Lendra learns to bind 2 runes to the same item (DC +5).
    
- **Rune Discovery**: She doesn’t start with all of these. They’re hidden in **Forebearer ruins, etched on walls, embedded in old constructs, or seen in visions**. Each discovery feels like unlocking forbidden tech.
