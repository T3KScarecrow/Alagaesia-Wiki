In a hidden glade deep within Du Weldenvarden, there lies a towering obelisk of black crystal, its surface carved with runes that shimmer faintly under moonlight. Known as the Singing Obelisk, it is said to emit an otherworldly hum when both Aegirion and Aelora align in the sky.

Legend attributes the creation of the obelisk to Aelthion, who sought to immortalize the sound of the stars. According to ancient records, the obelisk resonates with celestial music, inaudible to mortal ears unless amplified by the alignment of the moons. Those who hear the melody speak of visionsâ€”shimmering constellations, endless voids, and glimpses of a world beyond comprehension.

Despite its beauty, the obelisk is surrounded by tragedy. Explorers have claimed that prolonged exposure to its song leads to madness, the mind unable to grasp the infinite vastness conveyed through the melody. Some scholars argue this is not a curse but a test, a challenge left behind by Aelthion for those bold enough to seek enlightenment.
