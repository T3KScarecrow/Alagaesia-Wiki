**Ellesmera**, nestled deep within the dense, ancient trees of **Du Weldenvarden**, is the heart of [[AAA The Forestfolk|elven]] civilization and a symbol of their enduring harmony with nature. Hidden from prying eyes by powerful illusions, Ellesmera seems to shift and blend into the Great Forest itself. The city is a natural extension of the forest, with towering trees that have been gently shaped over centuries into elegant, livable structures. The elves have tended and guided these trees to grow into graceful halls, spiraling towers, and arched bridges, all seamlessly intertwined with the forest’s natural growth.  

The city is awash with a quiet, ethereal beauty. Massive trees, hundreds of feet tall, serve as the foundation of the city, and pathways of woven roots and vines crisscross the city’s upper levels, where the elven elite live. The architecture reflects elven reverence for their surroundings: there is no cutting, hewing, or breaking. Instead, trees have been grown into halls with arching doorways, and homes seem to emerge from the trunks, vines adorning their entrances like natural tapestries. This gives Ellesmera an air of tranquillity and timelessness, as though it has existed since the forest's beginning.

**The Hall of Stars**, an open-air amphitheatre made of interwoven branches, is where the elves gather to sing and recount their histories under the starlit sky. Here, the trees and stones seem to resonate with the voices of the elves, amplifying their songs and tales with a haunting, otherworldly echo. The **High Council** meets in the centre of Ellesmera led by the prestigious **Queen Islanzadi**, where a massive, hollowed-out tree serves as a council chamber, its interior lined with intricate carvings that illustrate elven lore and the ancient pacts with the forest.

The city is guarded by **the Spellguard**, elven warriors attuned to the forest’s magic, who use illusions, traps, and the shifting trees themselves to deter intruders. It is said that those who wander too close to Ellesmera without invitation become lost in endless pathways, guided away by whispering leaves and shadows.

Overall, Ellesmera stands as a hidden sanctuary, a place where the boundary between civilization and nature blurs, embodying the deep connection the elves share with the Great Forest.
