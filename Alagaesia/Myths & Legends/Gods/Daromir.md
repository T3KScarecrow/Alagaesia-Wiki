Originally known by the [[The Forebearers|Forebearers]] as Daromythos, Daromir is [[The Vulgomage|Vulgomage]] god of seas, storms, and voyages. A tempestuous god whose moods control the seaâ€™s wrath or favour, sailors and traders regularly offer prayers to him in attempts to sate his attitude. He is represented as a muscular man with scaley trousers and no shirt, long black and wet hair in which rests a golden pointed headband. When he walks on the mortal plane, he appears as a wizened fisherman, or as a large octopus.
