> Of all the rumors surrounding the Forebearers’ creations, none are as tantalizing—or terrifying—as those of the Clockwork Colossus. The few remaining fragments of Forebearer lore speak of a towering construct built not for war but for defense, its gears imbued with purpose by magic long lost to us. This was no mindless automaton; the Colossus was said to possess a spark of sentience, an unrelenting guardian of the Forebearer sanctuaries.

> The ruins of Hargraven, where I conducted much of my research, hold carvings depicting a colossal figure, limbs of gleaming metal and a heart aglow with unearthly light. Some claim these are mere symbols, allegories for the strength of the Forebearers’ magic. But I found something more compelling: a shard of metal, warm to the touch even after centuries, humming faintly with an internal rhythm. Could this be a piece of the Colossus?

> Stories tell of the construct’s downfall—or, more accurately, its abandonment. When the Forebearers fell, their creations were left to decay. The Colossus, it is said, lies dormant beneath the earth, waiting for the return of its masters or some foolish adventurer to rouse it. A warning to all who would seek such a treasure: the Colossus was designed to destroy anything it perceived as a threat. Without the knowledge to command it, one might find themselves on the wrong side of its immense power.
