The Vulgomage are those of the majority populous who don't fit into any other faction. They are divided in their ideologies to do with magic, but united in their pursuit of individual freedom. 

### Kingdoms of The Vulgomage:

#### 1. **Caelora** (The Central Kingdom)

Located in the heart of the land, **Caelora** is the largest and most prominent Vulgomage kingdom. It was founded after the retreat of the elves and dwarves and has become the cultural and political center of the Vulgomage. Known for its towering spires and grand libraries, Caelora is a place of learning, magic, and innovation, drawing from the remnants of Forebearer wisdom. The capital city, also called Caelora, is a sprawling metropolis that rises out of the fertile plains, fortified by natural and arcane defenses. The ruling council of Caelora, known as the **Magisterium**, is a gathering of the most powerful mages in the land, each controlling a vast network of students and vassals.

#### 2. **Thalassara** (The Northern Port City)

**Thalassara** is situated to the northeast, close to the edge of the **Du Weldenvarden**, The Great Forest, and overlooking the sea. The name **Thalassara** is derived from ancient Vulgomage words for "sea" and "watch," reflecting its role as both a trade hub and a sentinel city guarding the northern approaches. Its proximity to the elven realms has made it a place of uneasy but important exchanges, with some Forestfolk venturing to the city to trade or share knowledge. The city's architecture is a blend of elven grace and human ingenuity, with sleek towers of wood and stone that mirror the nearby trees. Thalassara is known for its enchanted docks, where arcane mechanisms aid in shipbuilding and trade, and its mages specialize in water-based magic and elemental control.

#### 3. **Ostholme** (The Southern Port City)

Located on the southeastern coast, **Ostholme** is the southernmost Vulgomage kingdom, a bustling port city that serves as the gateway to distant lands across the seas. Ostholme's position on the warm southern waters has made it a melting pot of cultures, with traders and sailors from all over the world passing through. The city's mages are known for their mastery of wind and storm magics, aiding in navigation and the protection of ships from the treacherous sea. Ostholme is a city of contrasts, where opulent mansions rise alongside bustling markets and docks filled with exotic goods. Its ruling council, known as the **Thalassocracy**, is composed of wealthy merchant-mages who control the flow of trade and magic throughout the kingdom.

These three kingdoms form the backbone of Vulgomage society, each one distinct but bound together by shared history and the pursuit of magical knowledge.
