Ironfell is a robust city situated within the mountainous region that marks the border between Stoner territory and the Vulgomage kingdom of Caelora. Though not officially governed by either faction, its culture and society bear strong influences from both: the practical craftsmanship of the dwarves and the arcane pursuits of the Vulgomage. Ironfell stands as a testament to ingenuity born from necessity, thriving in a craggy, iron-rich expanse.

### History
Ironfell was established centuries ago as a joint venture between dwarves and Vulgomage pioneers seeking to capitalize on the abundant mineral resources embedded in the mountains. Over time, it grew from a modest mining town into a fortified city known for its sturdy fortifications and intricate network of underground passages. The fusion of dwarven stonework and Vulgomage enchantments has turned Ironfell into a unique blend of martial readiness and magical sophistication.

### Governance
Ironfell is ruled by Duke Alaric Stonewrought, a powerful half-dwarf whose lineage grants him credibility among both Stoners and Vulgomage citizens. Duke Alaric is pragmatic and fiercely protective of the city, known for balancing the interests of its mixed populace. While not part of the Magistereum, he maintains an alliance with Caelora's council to ensure mutual benefits and protection.

### Main Exports
Ironfell’s primary exports include high-quality iron and steel, intricately designed weaponry, and arcane-infused armor, making it a critical supplier for armies and adventurers across the land. It is also renowned for its expert metallurgists who craft specialized alloys that command high prices.

### The Siege of Ironfell
The Siege of Ironfell is one of the most pivotal moments in the city’s history. Roughly two decades ago, Ironfell was targeted by a coalition of raiders allied with the Blood Cult of Skaro. The cult aimed to seize the city’s forges and infuse their unholy rituals with enchanted metal, which would bolster their dark practices. 

The attack was brutal, involving waves of undead thralls and blood-golems summoned by the cult. The city held its ground for weeks, thanks to the expertise of Duke Alaric and the Stoner warriors who arrived as reinforcements. Arcane wards laid by the Vulgomage artisans also played a crucial role, delaying the cult’s advances long enough for help to arrive. Ultimately, the combined might of Ironfell's defenders repelled the invaders, but not without significant loss and destruction.

Today, remnants of the siege are visible in the form of repaired breaches in the city walls and solemn monuments honoring those who fell during the battle. Ironfell’s reputation as a bastion of strength and unity endures, attracting merchants, warriors, and mages alike.
