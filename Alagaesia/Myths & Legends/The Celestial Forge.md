#### From _"Celestial Myths & Divine Histories"_ by Loremaster Caelwyn Eltharion

In dwarven legends, the _Celestial Forge_ is said to be the divine anvil upon which the gods forged the first stars, each struck from molten fragments of pure creation. This forge, according to myth, lies hidden beyond the night sky, shrouded in clouds of cosmic fire.

The elves, however, tell a different tale. They believe the Celestial Forge is not a physical place but a metaphor for the divine spark within every sentient being—the fire of ambition, creativity, and magic itself. It is said that those who look to the heavens and see only stars miss the forge’s true nature: a reminder that the gods gave mortals the tools to shape their own destinies.

Whether physical or metaphorical, the Forge remains a symbol of divine origin and mortal potential, its flames reflected in the countless fires lit by those seeking meaning in the stars.
