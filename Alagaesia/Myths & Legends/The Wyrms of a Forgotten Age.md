#### From _"Myths of Might and Mystery"_ by Cantrick Fairquill

In the days when the Forebearers still walked the land, when the heavens were closer to the earth, and the moons cast twin shadows upon unbroken forests, there were whispers of creatures unlike any known today. The old songs call them **Wyrms**, beasts of fire, storm, and shadow. But if you seek them now, you will find only legends, their presence erased so thoroughly that many doubt they ever lived at all.

The stories differ wildly, but all speak of the **Wyrms’ impossible grandeur**. Some say their wings stretched so far that they blotted out the sun, leaving fields cloaked in twilight as they soared overhead. Others claim they carried mountains on their backs or that their breaths were storms, each exhalation birthing hurricanes, blizzards, or firestorms. The moons Aegirion and Aelora, it is said, would glow brighter when a Wyrm took to the skies, as if the gods themselves turned their eyes to these mighty beings.

Forebearer carvings depict creatures resembling these descriptions—great serpentine forms with clawed limbs, coiled in battle with figures wielding radiant weapons. Could these be the Wyrms of legend? Or were they mere symbols of chaos, created to teach lessons about the dangers of hubris?

Some myths suggest that the Wyrms were not of this world. They came from beyond the stars, travellers like [[Aelthion - God of Curiosity & Learning|Aelthion]], drawn to our land by its magic. Others claim they were creations of the gods themselves, a test of mortal strength and ingenuity, or guardians set to protect the world’s greatest secrets.

But as with all things of power, there are darker tales. One speaks of the **Great Silence**, when the Forebearers, in their boundless ambition, sought to enslave the Wyrms. They crafted immense magical chains to bind the creatures to their will, to wield their flames and storms as weapons. The Wyrms, being creatures of pride and fury, would not yield.

The battle that followed was said to be apocalyptic. Mountains shattered, rivers boiled, and the very skies burned as Wyrms fought against their would-be masters. In the end, the Wyrms vanished, leaving nothing behind but scorched ruins and the faint scent of ash on the wind. Did they perish in their rebellion? Or did they retreat to the stars, vowing never to return to this land?

To this day, the faintest remnants of their power are said to linger. A traveler who ventures too close to a volcanic peak or a storm-wracked isle might feel the presence of something ancient, a shadow that does not move with the wind, a rumble that is not thunder. The bold—or the foolish—might even claim to have seen scales glinting in the firelight or heard the distant beat of wings as vast as the heavens.

Whether these stories are true or merely the fancies of frightened minds, none can say. Yet one question remains: if the Wyrms were real, and if they still watch from beyond the veil of the heavens, what would bring them back?
