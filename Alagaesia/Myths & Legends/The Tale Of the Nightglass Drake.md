#### From _"Draconic Myths and Shadowed Legends"_ by Alaric the Reckoner

Few creatures inspire more dread than the **Nightglass Drake**, a being woven from shadow and starfire, said to dwell where the barriers between the mortal world and the Astral Plane grow thin. Legends claim it was born of the cosmos itself—a shard of pure void given form, with scales as dark as a moonless sky and eyes like blazing comets.

It is told that the Drake cannot be slain by mortal weapons, for its very essence is tied to the fabric of the heavens. Arrows pass through its body as if through mist, and blades shatter upon its starry hide. Scholars posit that only light forged by celestial magic or the pure will of the gods can harm it.

The Nightglass Drake is neither good nor evil but acts as a cosmic balance, devouring stars that have burned too long or unleashing astral fire upon those who defy the natural order. Some whisper that the Drake is a servant of [[Aelthion - God of Curiosity & Learning|Aelthion]] himself, roaming the skies to safeguard his voyage into the celestial domain. Others claim it is a curse—a punishment unleashed when a mortal dares to reach too far into the forbidden mysteries of the stars.

Should one glimpse the Drake streaking across the heavens, it is said to be an omen: of discovery, destruction, or divine intervention. The wise keep their gaze to the ground, for to lock eyes with the Drake’s fiery stare is to invite madness—or worse, to be consumed by the void.
