I find myself amidst an eclectic group of companions, a kaleidoscope of personalities and quirks. Each is remarkable in their own way, though I feel quite small by comparisonâ€”metaphorically, of course. [[Natalie Porter]], once a captain, seems to carry the weight of her past with a quiet resolve. [[Wiate Wight]] and [[Alagaesia/Important People/Theramell|Theramell]], though less forthcoming, share a camaraderie that speaks of a bond forged through hardship. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper]], I've yet to meet, but I hear he is... eccentric.

[[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]], however, is a figure of peculiar intensity. His imposing frame and booming voice make him difficult to ignore, though his demeanour borders on reckless. I admit, I find him unnerving.

Still, tonight we shared a meal, a fleeting moment of calm before the unknown stretches before us. I retire now with equal parts trepidation and anticipation.
