#### From _"Constructs and Curiosities: Artifice of the Ancients"_ by Jorath Fizzlesprocket

A peculiar contraption, often mentioned in Forebearer accounts, is the Puzzle Golem. Unlike most constructs, which are purely functional, the Puzzle Golem appears to have been a test of wit and intellect. Its form is described as humanoid, crafted of interlocking pieces of brass and crystal that shift constantly, creating new patterns across its surface.

When activated, the Golem is written to challenge intruders with riddles, puzzles, and even games of strategy. Those who succeed in solving its mysteries are rewarded, often with access to hidden chambers or treasures of great value. Those who fail… well, let’s say the Golem’s patience is finite.

One scholar posited that the Puzzle Golem was more than a guardian; it was a teacher, imparting knowledge to those who proved themselves worthy. If such a construct still exists, its secrets could unlock untold Forebearer wisdom—or end the life of the seeker in a most creative fashion.
