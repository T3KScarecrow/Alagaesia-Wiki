The darkness of that cursed hall still lingers in my thoughts. Shadows that claw and mirrors that twist reality—it was a labyrinth of lies and truths. The "good" mirrors, though rare, showed memories untainted, a respite in the oppressive gloom. Yet, the "bad" mirrors... stepping through them drained the very light around us.

At the last of these mirrors, I glimpsed something unsettling—memories untouched by my conscious mind, as if they were stolen moments from a forgotten life. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper]] saw something similar, a tender fragment of his origins. It gave me pause: do these reflections hold truths we are not meant to know, or are they fabrications designed to manipulate?

[[Alagaesia/Important People/Gabriel|Gabriel]] and I turned back to rescue [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] and [[Wiate Wight|Wiate]], who were both in terrible peril. Shadows lashed out as if alive, and [[AR-8125   -   Aaron|Aaron]] bore the evidence of their savagery. Despite our setbacks, we found the way forward through [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper's]] vision.
