Mortalas is the Goddess of Mortality and a Lesser Goddess of Death. She is the mirror twin sister to Vitalas. Mortalas is the perfect reflection of her sister, but where Vitalas is radiant and warm, Mortalas is serene and solemn. Her long, flowing hair is silver-white, cascading like moonlight over her shoulders, an ethereal contrast to her dark attire. Her eyes are deep, endless black, not void of warmth but filled with the quiet understanding of all things ending. Her skin is pale, almost translucent in certain lights, giving her an unearthly, dreamlike quality.

She wears flowing robes identical to her sister's but in the deepest shades of black, embroidered with silver thread in delicate swirling patterns that resemble drifting souls. The fabric moves like mist, seeming to ripple with unseen currents. Around her head, a thin silver circlet rests, set with a single onyx gemstone. When she walks, the faint sound of distant chimes follows, like funeral bells carried on the wind.

Mortalas does not bring death, nor does she take joy in it. She is a silent guide, a patient shepherd of souls. When the dying see her, they feel neither fear nor painâ€”only peace. Those who have suffered greatly in life find solace in her embrace, as she ensures they find their rightful place in the afterlife.

Unlike other gods of death, Mortalis is largely forgotten. Many worship deities who rule death with an iron fist, wielding it as a weapon or a punishment. But Mortalis simply watches, ensuring that no soul is lost or abandoned. Her name is whispered only in mourning halls and by those who understand that death, though sorrowful, is also a necessary part of existence.
