Deep within charred forests and lands ravaged by firestorms, there wanders a creature of haunting beauty: the **Cindermourn Stag**. Its antlers are said to be made of glowing embers, and its eyes burn with the intensity of a dying star. Though it leaves no tracks and no sound betrays its movements, a faint scent of smoke always lingers where it has passed.

The Cindermourn Stag is no ordinary beast. Many believe it is a harbinger of renewal, arriving to cleanse lands that have grown stagnant and pave the way for new growth. Its appearance often coincides with wildfires that reduce forests to ash, but the Stag itself is never seen to harm or destroy. Rather, it moves among the flames, untouched by the heat, its presence both eerie and serene.

Hunters who have tried to slay the Stag speak of arrows turning to ash mid-flight and swords crumbling to cinders upon striking it. Some say the Stag is protected by Aeloria herself, a manifestation of mysteries and cycles beyond mortal comprehension.

Those rare souls who claim to have seen the Stag up close tell of an overwhelming sense of sorrow in its presence, as though it carries the grief of every forest it has ever walked. To see it is both a blessing and a curse: a promise of rebirth, but also a reminder that life must first end for it to begin anew.
