The Lantern of Eternal Light is a relic shrouded in myth and mystery, often attributed to the Forebearers' mastery of combining artifice and divine magic. This device is said to be a self-sustaining source of illumination, burning with a cold, silver flame that neither consumes fuel nor emits heat.

Accounts of the lantern describe it as a beautifully ornate object, its frame crafted from an alloy of unknown metals and encrusted with crystals that pulse faintly in rhythm with the moons. Ancient texts suggest it was not merely a source of light but a conduit for lunar energy, able to amplify spells or protect against dark forces.

The lantern’s last known appearance was during the Fall of the Forebearers, where it was supposedly carried into battle by a guardian knight who vanished amidst the chaos. Treasure hunters dream of uncovering this artifact, though many dismiss it as a tale concocted to lure the gullible. If the Lantern of Eternal Light does exist, one can only wonder what secrets it might illuminate—or what shadows it might banish.
