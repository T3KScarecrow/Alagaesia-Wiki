In the depths of Du Weldenvarden,
Hidden amongst the green
Lies the ancient and wonderful Menoa garden.
A beautiful rift separate from reality
Wherein stands a sentinel of morality,
Menoa rises up to the sky,
Protecting her plants
With her ever-watchful eye.
But before Menoa could reach for the heavens,
She had to first plunge her roots down to hell,
For Menoa
