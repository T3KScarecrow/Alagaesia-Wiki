Atlazara, known originally in ancient Forebearer times as *Atlazharian Prime*, is an awe-inspiring underwater city that showcases the pinnacle of Forebearer ingenuity. Situated deep within the sapphire depths of the Azure Abyss, this city is a testament to advanced artifice and arcane power. The grand domes and towering spires of Atlazara shimmer with a luminescent glow, powered by ancient crystal engines that harness the natural energies of the ocean. Elaborate mosaics depicting sea myths and cosmic patterns adorn its streets, while sprawling plazas echo with the resonances of history. 
The Tritons refer to *Atlazara* as **Talazoria**, which translates to "The Radiant Crown" in their language. This name reflects both their reverence for the city's grandeur and the shimmering, majestic quality that drew them to it. While *Atlazara* is still known by its shortened Forebearer name in historical texts and formal references, **Talazoria** is the common term used among the Tritons who now inhabit and steward the city.

### Forebearer History
Atlazara was constructed during the height of the Forebearer civilization when they sought to explore and master all realms, including the sea. It was meant to be an aquatic research and development hub, a place for experiments with water-bound elemental magic and mechanical innovations. The city’s central structure, the *Aquilarum Spire*, was designed as an observatory and a nexus for studying the oceanic currents and the interplay between arcane forces and the deep sea.

Mysteriously, during the Fall of the Forebearers, Atlazara was abandoned. Some suggest that an experiment went awry, forcing the Forebearers to evacuate, while others believe the city was sealed intentionally to contain a secret power.

### Triton Settlement and Modern History
Centuries after the Fall, the Tritons discovered the city, drawn to its luminous aura. Naming it *Atlazara*, which translates to "Crown of the Deep," they were captivated by its splendor and its still-functional technology. With reverence and curiosity, the Tritons adapted the city for their own, blending their aquatic culture with the remnants of Forebearer craftsmanship.

Under Triton stewardship, Atlazara became a center for innovation and governance. The *Tide Council*, the ruling body of the Undersea, convenes in the *Spire of Tides*, once known as the *Aquilarum Spire*. This council is led by High Regent Thalmaris, a wise and charismatic Triton whose deep understanding of Forebearer relics has solidified the city’s importance as a technological and political hub.
