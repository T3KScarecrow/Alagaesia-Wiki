Nestled in a clearing within the dense, shadowy pines of the wilds, the halfling village of **Shortstaig** sits quietly, often blanketed in the soft mist that rolls in from the surrounding forest. The trees form a natural barrier around the village, giving Shortstaig an air of gentle isolation. Built for peace and privacy, the village seems to blend into the landscape as if it grew directly from the earth itself.

Shortstaig is small by any standard, with cottages built low to the ground, topped with moss-covered roofs that look like they’ve grown out of the surrounding fields. Each home has a small plot of land where residents tend to neat vegetable gardens, herb patches, and flower beds. Small farms fill in the edges of the clearing, worked slowly and patiently by the older halflings who now call this village home. The fields are tilled by hand, and the community raises hardy chickens, a few pigs, and an occasional goat to provide fresh milk and eggs for the village.

### **Village Life and Community**

Life here is calm and revolves around simple comforts, the change of the seasons, and the quiet companionship of the villagers. Most of Shortstaig’s residents are elderly halfling couples who, content with a simple life, spend their days tending to their homes and farms. It’s rare to see anyone younger than fifty in the village, though now and again, a visiting grandchild may appear.  

The locals rarely leave Shortstaig, as the journey through the surrounding forest is long and tricky, and the village has all they need to live comfortably. For most, the forest that surrounds them is both a guardian and a mystery. Few know what lies beyond the treeline, but the villagers have faith that whatever it is will remain out of sight as long as they leave it undisturbed.

### **Local Characters and Gathering Places**

Shortstaig has a few key places and personalities that form its core:

- **Korin the Blacksmith**: A rough-edged, gruff blacksmith who manages a small, somewhat disorganized forge in the village’s heart. Though not particularly talkative, Korin is well-liked for his reliability and his generous habit of repairing tools and nails free of charge for the village elders.

- **Old Wensly, the Librarian**: The bespectacled and kindly Wensly maintains Shortstaig’s tiny library, a cozy, book-lined cottage that was once his own home. Every Tuesday afternoon, Wensly holds a storytelling session, reciting tales from the region’s history or reading from his well-worn scrolls and tomes. Some call him the “history-keeper” of Shortsaig, though he’d never claim such a title.

- **Marta the Tanner**: Harsh in tone but tender-hearted beneath the surface, Marta manages her tanning business out on the far edge of the village, away from most homes. She’s a rare figure in Shortstaig for her worldly experience, having lived for some years as a wandering merchant. Though she might grumble about young halflings these days, she is often the one to welcome new faces, including the annual merchants.

- **The Mossy Tankard**: The village’s lone pub, a small, cheery place of well-worn wood and halfling-sized chairs, is the gathering point for the villagers. The pub serves a simple but satisfying menu, primarily warm, spiced drinks and a local, fruity ale brewed by the pub’s proprietor, **Hob Stonefoot**, who is as kind as he is forgetful. Even on the quietest evenings, the Mossy Tankard always has a fire crackling and a few halflings sharing stories or news from the day.

### **The Annual Festival of the Travellers**

Once a year, the sleepy village bursts into life for a week-long celebration. A caravan of merchants, entertainers, and wanderers travels to Shortstaig, bringing with them spices, fabrics, trinkets, and tales from distant lands. It’s a time the villagers look forward to for the entire year, and they save whatever extra goods or coins they can to make small purchases or barter for rare treats.

During this week, every night is filled with laughter, music, and the flickering light of bonfires built near the merchants' camp. Halflings gather to watch jugglers, hear new tales of adventure, and browse through rare wares from across the land. Hob Stonefoot even expands his menu with delicacies provided by the travellers, and the Mossy Tankard overflows with villagers and visitors alike. For these nights, Shortstaig feels larger than it is, brimming with warmth and joy.

Though simple and secluded, Shortstaig is a gem hidden in the wilds. Its community is small but resilient, sustained by the warmth of companionship, the rhythm of a steady life, and the annual promise of festivities that remind the villagers of the world beyond the trees. For those who know it, Shortsaig is a peaceful haven, offering a quiet life that is rich in the things that truly matter.
