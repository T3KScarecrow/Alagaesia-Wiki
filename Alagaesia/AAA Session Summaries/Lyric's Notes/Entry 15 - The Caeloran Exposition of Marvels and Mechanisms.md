Today was the first day of the Expo! I was so excited to see all the amazing gadgets and inventions on display. The party took a bit of convincing to attend it with me, but they did in the end. There was this instrument device that soothes all who hear its song; a magical floating quill which supposedly never runs out of ink, and doesn't even need an author's hand to be used; these bauble objects that release magic upon impact, causing a flash of bright light, the area of impact to be covered in a slippery substance, or even a small explosion; and finally, an amazing pair of mechanical boots which release high pressure air to boost the wearer's jumps.

Vesper was up to some peculiar shenanigans, as always. This time, after plastering a crude mimicry of wanted posters of himself all around Caelora City, he masterfully disguised himself as an old spellcaster. To what end, I do not know. Part of me doubts even *he* knows.

I look forward to attending the Expo's tomorrow events
