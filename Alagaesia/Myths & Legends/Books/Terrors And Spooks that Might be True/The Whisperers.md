#### From _"Terrors and Spooks The Might Be True"_ by Beatrisa Wynstone

Among the bleak, wind-worn peaks of the distant north, where the howling winds carry secrets long forgotten, lurks a terror so insidious that those who speak of it often dare not utter its name. Some call them _The Whisperers_, while others know them only by the hollow echoes of their stolen voices. They are not ghosts, nor mere tricksters of the frost, but something older—something that does not belong in the world of men.

Stories tell of wanderers and lost souls who vanish without a trace, leaving behind only the sound of their own voices calling for help long after they are gone. Travelers in these remote regions have reported hearing loved ones speaking to them in the dead of night, their voices warped ever so slightly, stretched thin over the sound of snapping branches and shifting snow. But when they rise to investigate, there is no one there—only a deeper silence settling in the wake of something unseen.

The Whisperers do not simply kill; they _take_. They watch, they listen, and when they understand you well enough, they steal your voice, your mannerisms, and eventually... something deeper. Hunters speak of entire cabins found empty, their doors left open to the wind, food still warm on the table, as if the inhabitants had merely stepped outside for a moment—only to never return. The unsettling truth is that, sometimes, the voices of the missing are heard weeks later, calling from the woods, speaking nonsense, begging to be let inside.

One account, scrawled hastily in a trapper’s log, warns: _Do not answer when you hear your own voice in the trees. Do not speak when it asks you to. If it calls to you in the voice of your mother, your child, your dearest friend—run. They are already gone._

Some scholars believe The Whisperers may be spirits of the frozen wilds, ancient and hungry. Others claim they are something worse: a force without form, feeding on the weak, waiting patiently for the moment you let your guard down. If they truly exist, then perhaps their greatest trick is making us believe they do not.

For what could be more terrifying than the voice of someone you love… beckoning from the dark?
