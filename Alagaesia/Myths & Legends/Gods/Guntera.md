Guntera is the chief of the [[The Dwarves|dwarven]] deities, and is believed to be the one who created the world. It is said that Guntera moulded the world, with its caves and mountains, from the World Clay. [[The Dwarves]] believe that they are of living stone, and therefore are closer to the divine designs of Guntera. It is also believed that Guntera moulded the first [[The Dwarves|dwarves]] from the World Clay.
