The _Gilded Pride_ is a renowned group of adventurers who bear the symbol of a gold lion on their banners, armour, and insignia. Known throughout Caelora and beyond for their bravery, tactical acumen, and unwavering loyalty to one another, they have become icons of heroism and a beacon of hope to the common folk.

#### Symbolism and Reputation

The gold lion represents not only their courage and regal bearing but also their fierce loyalty and leadership. This party is known for taking on quests that others fear to touch—whether it’s venturing into the dark depths of ancient ruins, battling terrifying beasts, or dismantling the cults that threaten the stability of the land. Their crest is immediately recognized, striking awe in the hearts of allies and a cold dread in the hearts of their foes.

#### Party Composition

1. **Captain Darius Blackmane** – _Human Paladin (Oath of Devotion)_  
    Darius is the charismatic leader of the _Gilded Pride_, known for his golden-blond hair and gleaming suit of enchanted armour. He wields a longsword blessed by the priests of Vitalos, capable of striking down enemies with radiant force. His unwavering faith in justice and loyalty to his comrades has earned him a near-legendary status.
    
2. **Elara Windwhisper** – _Half-Elf Bard (College of Valour)_  
    Elara's voice is said to bring both inspiration and dread, depending on which side of her song you stand. With a lute always at her side and a sharp rapier in hand, she bolsters her party's morale while striking down foes with finesse. Her tales of heroism have spread across taverns in [[The Vulgomage|Caelora]], making her songs synonymous with the party's triumphs.
    
3. **Thrain Stoneforge** – _Dwarf Fighter (Battle Master)_  
    Thrain is the party's tactical genius and master of weapons. His heritage as a former blacksmith from Ironhenge shows in his carefully crafted weapons and armour. Stern and pragmatic, Thrain holds a deep respect for tradition and is the quiet, unyielding pillar of the group.
    
4. **Seraphina the Emberblade** – _Human Sorcerer (Draconic Bloodline)_  
    A flame-haired woman with a mysterious lineage, Seraphina’s draconic blood grants her a fearsome affinity for fire. Quick to ignite in battle and equally quick to smile when among friends, she is the group's arcane artillery, capable of unleashing devastating spells that can turn the tide of combat.
    
5. **Rennick Sharpfang** – _Goblin Rogue (Arcane Trickster)_  
    Rennick is the unexpected member of the _Gilded Pride_ but perhaps its most cunning. With an eye for detail and nimble fingers, he scouts ahead, disarms traps, and turns the tides with his precise sneak attacks. Once distrusted due to his goblin heritage, he has earned the respect of his comrades through loyalty and sharp wit.
    

#### Notable Adventures

The _Gilded Pride_ rose to fame after leading the defence during the _Siege of Ironfell_, where they repelled waves of marauders and beastly creatures threatening the city. They also played a pivotal role in uncovering the plots of the _Blood Cult of Skaro_, thwarting dark rituals and saving innocent lives from unspeakable fates. Their recent efforts have been directed toward the discovery of [[The Forebearers|Forebearer]] ruins, putting them at odds with the shadowy machinations of the [[The Mechinators|Mechinators]].

#### Group Dynamics

Despite their shared dedication, the _Gilded Pride_ has a range of personalities that create a colourful dynamic. Darius’s steadfastness balances Elara’s playful nature, while Thrain’s stoicism tempers Seraphina’s fiery temperament. Rennick’s clever antics often lighten the mood, though he is the first to stand in the way of danger for his friends.

#### Recognition

The _Gilded Pride’s_ reputation is such that their arrival in a town is met with both cheer and quiet whispers. To see their banner—a golden lion rearing with a mane of blazing gold—waving in the distance is to know that salvation, or at least daring, is on its way.
