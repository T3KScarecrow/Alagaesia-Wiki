Alden used to be an artificer that specialised in making the warforged for the Mechinators, but as he grew older, he realised that his Myasthenia Gravis was growing worse. Realising that he wouldn't be able to be an artificer anymore, he decided to put that part of his life behind him and went off to live a quiet and peaceful life on his own farm. He quickly learned that running a farm alone was no easy task, especially in his condition, so, using his experience, Alden made three warforged; AS-7924 (Asher), AN-6347 (Andrew) and AR-8125 (Aaron), to be farmhands. However, even with the help, he still grew weaker by the day.

After some months working the farm with his pseudo-children, Alden He decided to use what time he had left to try and give self awareness to the three that had helped him in the time he spent with the farm. He first tried Asher, but upon Asher's awakening, he immediately lashed out and went insane, blowing himself up. Alden realised that the reason was that Asher had kept all previous memories, and because of this, it was like a flood of memories hitting him at once, causing him to go mad, so Alden made sure that the other 2 only remembered that they are related to each other, and that in some way the 2 remaining warforged are related like siblings, and with that, Alden had started working on Aaron and Andrew for them to gain self awareness. 

Sometime later, Aaron had awoken, and upon leaving the workshop that was used for the 3 warforged, he saw that the farm was half destroyed after a raid party rolled through, stealing anything they could and killing anyone in their way, but luckily they didnt find the workshop. After looking around the now destroyed farm, he finds the lifeless body of Alden, with a stack of papers on a desk next to him. It's a log of everything about the 3 warforged, explaining how he made them, his plan to make them self aware, how the first went mad, and some entries about Andrew. It says that he had woken up early, just before the raid, and saying that he wished to explore the world now that hes free, and to tell Aaron to come looking for him when he wakes up. Aaron sees a map in between all the notes and takes it, intending to do what his "brother" had asked him to, no matter what
