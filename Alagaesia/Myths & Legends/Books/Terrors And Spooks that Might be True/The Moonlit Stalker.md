#### From _"Terrors and Spooks That Might Be True"_ by Beatrisa Wynstone

There is a tale told by travellers and wanderers, so believe it if you must, of a creature that prowls the world when Aegirion casts its brightest light. Known as the Moonlit Stalker, original, I know, this beast is said to hunt only those who walk alone under the full moon, punishing the arrogant who tread fearlessly in the domain of night.

The Stalker’s form is nebulous in description: a wolf-like shadow as tall as a man, with eyes that burn like molten silver. Its steps leave no trace, and its howl is so piercing it can shatter glass. Some believe the creature is a punishment sent by [[Khonshu]] himself, a grim reminder of his vow to protect travellers by eliminating those who would cause harm—or who stray too far into hubris. Those who believe this must be daft and unread, as this is not [[Khonshu|Khonshu's]] way.

Legends warn against meeting the creature’s eyes, for those who do are said to become cursed, haunted by their silver glow even in the brightest day. Some claim that the Stalker doesn’t kill outright but leaves its victims alive to serve as eternal warnings, their minds fractured by endless visions of the moons above.

Be it divine retribution or a campfire scare, the Moonlit Stalker’s tale is enough to keep most travellers within the safety of their camps on full-moon nights. Most.
