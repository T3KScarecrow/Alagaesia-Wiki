The [[The Elves|elven]] township known as **Lenoria**, is a serene settlement deep within the enchanted expanse of Du Weldenvarden. With tall, silver-barked trees that glimmer under the perpetual canopy, the town is woven seamlessly with the natural environment, blending wooden structures and hanging bridges with the mystical foliage. Lenoria is known for its whispering glades and glistening pools where elven spellcasters practice their art under the moon's glow.

### History:
Many years ago, the caretaker of Lenoria, Vorone Thalorien stepped down from the role, but insisted the title be passed down to his daughter, Aelindir Thalorien. None disputed this decision as Vorone had been a kind and benevolent overseer. This had been the wrong choice. Without earning the title, the young, immature elf Aelindir wrought annoyance and raucous wherever they went, much to the chagrin of his people. Despite the mounting dislike towards her amongst the people, her citizens held their tongues, choosing to outlive the problem without conflict. For years, the young caretaker's shenanigans ravaged the psyche of the townsfolk, until one day someone rose up. A young orphan by the name of [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper]], Thalorien's own court jester stole the crown from right off the nuisance's head during a performance in the town amphitheatre. This one brave yet incredibly rude act inspired the other residents, and gave them the courage to remove Aelindir from the court and elect a new caretaker in Ilyrana Evershade. [[Alagaesia/Important People/Vesper|Vesper]] himself had quite the reputation for mischief, but the townsfolk choose to overlook this about him, choosing instead to dub him the town hero.

### Important Locations:
- **Vesper’s Circle**: A stone amphitheater where Vesper's act of rebellion occurred. Now a place of storytelling and music, it serves as a reminder of the boldness that brought change.
- **The Glimmerheart Forge**: An artisanal workshop run by skilled elven smiths who craft masterpieces for the sake of art. This place has no exchange of currency, only admiration and the sharing of techniques.
- **Lenorian Sanctuary**: A tranquil space for contemplation and spellcraft. It is an open grove lined with runes that resonate with ancient Forebearer energy.
  
### Important People:
- **Vesper**: The orphaned jester turned hero whose daring act gave the townsfolk courage. Though mischievous, Vesper is now considered a symbol of change and boldness.
- **Aelindir Thalorien**: The former overseer, young and haughty, who failed to earn the respect of Lenoria's residents. Her passive-aggressive nature and immaturity led to his downfall.
